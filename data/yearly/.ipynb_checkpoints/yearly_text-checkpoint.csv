AskEconomics,2021,"  Some specific things (such as production of consumer goods) have historically been done better by private enterprises than by SOEs. The point being made in the meta-analysis was more that SOEs *as a category* do not perform worse than private enterprises *as a category*. There might still be specific things that each type of enterprise can do better than the other (e.g. the public is better at utilities, while the private is better at restaurants).   Thank you!

That leads to another follow up question.

Is there any studies/evidence that point to which industries should be state run and which should be private?   There are specific studies done by sector, but these mostly relate only to profitability and efficiency measures, which, as we've seen, can give an unfair advantage to private enterprises (by not taking into account the positive externalities generated by SOEs). I'm not aware of any industry-by-industry studies that take these factors into account, unfortunately."

U wish that much was going to stimulus checks to low and middle income.  Theres no way 328 milion out of 350 million are getting checks.  Middle to upper middle class and wealthy dont get em.  Any adult who didnt or couldnt do taxes last year dont get em.  The list continues.  The point is that its way lower than 328mil.  You can look it up how many ppl got em state by state.  Add it up.  It was under 200mil but cant recall right offhand.  

And we already know that money went to lots of stuff.  Some to pharma to develop the vaccines.  Some for PPE.  Some to manufacture shit like ventilators.

[removed]   I guess that‚Äôs kind of my point. In order to regain the center right, we need a way to engage and speak to them, rather than just lumping them in with the crazies on far end of their spectrum.   If they win elections then sure. Democrats would prefer 50 conservative Dem senators to 50 Republican senators because when it comes down to it the Dems will vote for Schumer while the Repubs will vote for McConnell.   Keep it civil. Do not personally insult other Redditors, or make racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise discriminatory remarks. Constructive debate is good; mockery, taunting, and name calling are not.   We have Rudy Guiliani making [arguments like](https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/)

&gt;‚ÄúThis is not a fraud case""

Despite earlier, in the same fucking argument, alleging fraud.

And based on ""evidence"" and ""procedure"" like that, tens of millions of Americans believe that the court system is corrupt and millions of votes should be tossed out. 

I don't know how to interpret that as anything other than ""voting for Biden isn't allowed and is considered corrupt"".

Tens of millions of Americans support the attempt to disenfranchise millions. 

Why should I believe those people would have any more of an issue with trump pardoning someone for killing any senator or congressman who refuses to throw out all votes for his opponents?

It's the ""patriotic"" thing to do when Biden voters aren't having their votes tossed by the ""corrupt courts"".   Please follow thread specific rules."
PoliticalHumor,2021,"  [deleted]   Yep. Like Narnia, or Japan.   So much fucking privilege these millennials have.   With the amount of upvotes this post has it's more clear to me than ever that what Reddit actually wants isn't socialism or communism.   No!! Socialism is communism is fascism is bad!! Listen to your cold war era propaganda!!!! YOU HAVE TO HATE AND EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH IT ENTIRELY. ALL ASPECTS ARE BAD.   You missed the fundamentals: tax breaks only help the wealthy.

So obviously.   Intended meaning: socialism is good  
  
Unintended meaning: millennials are politically clueless   Na, some of us just think and take a look at Venezuela instead. But then sometimes we think of crony capitalism and look at Russia. There‚Äôs always examples of poorly ran countries with any economic system. You would think by now we would realize that, it‚Äôs not the economic system that determines a countries worth or lack there of. It‚Äôs how inclusive the institutions are and how well the politicians represent the interests of the people while keeping in check interests that don‚Äôt benefit anyone. Governance is a very difficult balance between terrible policy on the left and terrible policy on the right. Getting it right is a skill and maybe some luck too.   Sure if they had to worry about an actual military and not a bunch of chairborne soldiers who think they know how to shoot. The military has many ways to reinforce and rearm. Unless Civilians can figure out how to make tanks stop or beat aircraft carriers they don't have a chance. This doesn't even take into account drone attacks and against any condensed target Tomahawk Missile strikes. There is literally no way that civilians with civilian weapons have a chance to stop a tyrannical government if the government is supported by the military. Hell armored vehicles with 50 cals and mark 19's will pretty much win let alone tanks and planes.   Really?   üòÇ   You were wrong. Literally everything you said was false. Trump far outpaces Obama in drone strikes that affect civilians.

Lmao   Pretty sure it‚Äôs a kingdom. King Carl Gustav. 

I‚Äôm not googling this, I‚Äôm an American. But pretty sure it‚Äôs not a Republic at all.   This post is bad and you should feel bad   Which occurred far more under Trump than Obama, but you didn't know that.   I appreciate the king representing the leftists, but also resent the association because anarchy   You're insane.   First off, fuck you Mitch and the clique you claim...   *woosh*   I thought they were states of Norway.   [deleted]   Not US politics.   I turned Tinder on in Northern Ontario and got two results. I'm not talking matches, I'm talking just two people to even swipe on.

Doesn't like 40% of all Canadians live in three cities?   Have you ever thought that maybe your Canadian friends are assholes?   Dude, it's obvious from your reddit account that you're just another paper pusher that's too stupid to get a better job. I retired at 55 in 2012 and you have decades of work to look forward to. Go get a better job and stop making your circumstances everybody else's fault. Show this post to your mommy. I'm sure she's very proud of her kid, the whiny bitch.   Perhaps housing costs for those not being paid 200k?   Insightful as shit   Term limits just ensures corruption because before the politicians even get into office they are planning and scheming giving out favors and deals to set up their next job after this job ends. It will actually make this problem worse. And would also preclude the only good politician in the country, Bernie Sanders.   No, socialism is when you take the full step towards collective ownership of the means of production   Yea she was never a normal person and didn't know how to be one. Saying that, she's was always super intelligent and I want a President in that office that is smarter than me. Of the last 3, we're one for three. I'm confident Biden at least is concerned most about competency and hopefully he's a bit more forceful than Obama was.   Too articulate for trump. He‚Äôs more likely to be remembered for ‚ÄúWoman, Man, Person, Camera, TV‚Äù   Nah, they don't have any bland or disappointing failures of flavors.   Isn't Switzerland where Tenants can request a rent decrease when interest rates are cut? I've read or seen videos of tenants in switzerland being reimbursed for rent reduction. Sounds pretty socialist compared to America (Fuck Yeah/s)   [removed]   [removed]   Demsoc is socialism though- not socdem however.   Yeah, but then you have to live in Winnipeg...   this isnt humor.. its probably truth   Lol yes I already knew socialists weren't the smartest bunch   What about Amsterdam? That‚Äôs a country in Sweden right   Welcome to the point of the meme. Misunderstanding socialism isn't strictly one generation; **however**, Canada's social policies are a better than the US'. It is why they beat the US in the ""freedom"" and ""happiness"" indexes.   The way the term is used by the American right has changed the meaning significantly.   For the dickhead who will surely shout this is a lie 


https://www.themarshallproject.org/records/4692-cops-planting-evidence   Not quit universal healthcare, no. We do have mandatory health insurance though, which has a similar effect I believe.   I'm surprised you're still alive and haven't been run down by some random car jacker yet   The morality of the issue is not the problem here. The problem is that the GOP wants to have their cake and eat it, too. The truth is, you *cannot* say ""we are the party of small government, but--"" because whatever you put after the **""but""** undermines whatever you put before it. That's just someone being a duplicitous two-faced hypocrite... which, now that I think about it, is pretty much standard  procedure for conservatives anyway.   Half of those accomplishments are straight up lies lol   &gt; But it comes back to- but why should I pay for it?

Besides it being morally right, it also makes sense selfishly because a well-educated and happier populace makes our whole country stronger and more prosperous, which affects all of us. It's in our best interest for everyone in our community to be healthy, well-educated, and housed.   Switzerland isn't socialism. It's capitalism with welfare.   You‚Äôre right. In theory, the US doesn‚Äôt murder democratically-elected socialist leaders that try to nationalize goods. Real works IS way different   I don‚Äôt give a shit about Nordic countries... but maybe I do.   Too bad they're so stupid they get sucked into Marxism and start rioting declaring anyone who doesn't agree with them a racist or a fascist.   Switzerland is the most capitalistic and corrupt country in Europe lol. Also they have way better gun rights than we do.   Marx used socialism and communism interchangeably. They were words that described the same thing, worker‚Äôs control of the means of production. It was Lenin who differentiated between the ‚Äúlower stage of communism‚Äù (I.e socialism) and ‚Äúhigher stage of communism‚Äù. Marx did talk about these different stages and a very important part of Marxist ideology is the end stage is a classless society. 

But yes I agree the final stage is impossible to determine. Both Marx and Lenin admitted as much   Pretty much.   &gt;Obviously he is stating that he was never taught history in school nor researched the subject.

What makes you say this?

&gt;Just another lazy person wanting a hand out!

Demanding your taxes be used to help people isn't a hand out, nor is it lazy. 


Maybe you dropped the ""/s""?   Your grandpa is a moron. Sorry.   Yeah a system designed to not pass any laws is an ‚Äúirrelevant talking point‚Äù

Sure is awesome that you elected Biden, too bad he‚Äôs not going to be able to do shit because of the senate and Supreme Court. 

Fuck your checks and balances. Didn‚Äôt stop Trump, won‚Äôt let Biden fix the country.   Gib walkin around money   Even then I'll take breadlines and gas rations and all that shit if it means I'll have a place to live, a job, and won't get left to die if I get sick.   As a pretty white boy living in Swedenland, I LOLed   What does those two things have to do with something being socialist or not? Is socialism to you that nobody has assets and corporate tax is 100%?   OK, but we already have a left/right wing continuum, and words have standard definitions so that different people can use them without misunderstanding.   [removed]   Yes Switzerland dummy.   Welcome to the point of the meme. Misunderstanding socialism isn't strictly one generation; **however**, the listed countries' social policies are a better than the US'. It is why they beat the US in the ""freedom"" and ""happiness"" indexes.   I mean there aren‚Äôt too many countries that are actually socialist.  Cuba is close.  I think a lot of people confuse socialism with ‚Äúhaving social programs‚Äù. Canada has public health care, and other social programs but we are nowhere near socialism by definition.   Nothing to see here! Just two friends hanging out with no repercussions for any of us whatsoever!   If only trp had any clout or leverage or care.   Communism isn't when the public owns everything, it's when individual stateless communes/soviets exist. It's basically anarchy (in the true sense), socialism with at most a municipal level of government. 


Although in practice, communism has often just been the ironic literal opposite of that. A strong totalitarian and often imperialistic dictatorship state by a single party, with hit or miss actual socialism. Seizing the means of production takes a strong hand, and unless you by chance get a line of Cincinnatus at the helm of the temporary dictatorship (in the true Roman sense), you get Stalin and Mao. Revolution communism has been shown to definitely not work well. Marx's ideals are oddly better met by this actualy working as the dictatorship of the proletariat (ie social democrat, Scandinavia), than by those actually calling themsleves Marxists.   On the [political spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum) they are in the context of left vs right, which was the context of the argument. I'm not sure what's the definition you are using, though.   Countries with free market = socialism according to Yas Queen Harry Potter bae theory   Cry. Loser.   In my opinion, no economic ideology is good when it is 100% the only thing that is used. A truly communist nation will fail because nobody is actually selfless or will work just to work for the greater good. Pure capitalism will fail on its own because we all will be dead as a result (same as pure communism). Pure socialism will fail in a large nation due to the logistics of catering to each individuals needs. The US is a mix on socialism and capitalism and people who don‚Äôt understand this could no joke do a 20 minute Google search like my lazy ass and understand   You think the checks and balances worked these last 4 years??   I looked closely at this picture and didn't see any red hats or Trump flags, so I think OP is lying about this.   Is this supposed to be a good thing? That means you're ignorant.   Yet another bullshit ‚Äúcheck and balance‚Äù that is supposed to stop fascists from coming to power, but instead put one in office instead.   No. Those are social systems. Unless you‚Äôre going to say ‚Äúgovernment paying for things‚Äù is socialist, then it‚Äôs not socialism.

An actual socialist country would have the government own the means of production for vast swathes of the economy. I guess you can argue that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening when the government takes over health insurance, but even that‚Äôs a stretch.

Nationalization of massive parts of the economy is socialism. Benefits for the unemployed or sick are not.   You just called the author of insane clown president, the divide, and I cant breathe a conservative? üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£

You're owning yourself like ben shapiro.


What's with this argument of ""written in the style of Hunter thompson"" as a negative? Thompson is a legendary journalist. It's also not true. Matt isn't on intoxicated adventures in any of these books. The closest to thompson is probably The Great Derangement where he goes undercover at a fundamentalist christian church. 

The Mueller report itself explicitly stated the opposite of what you're claiming, but you somehow claim to have a great trip on reality.  You're just blue maga - another shade of unreasonable fanatic.   I doubt most normal people hear socialism and think of anything other than ‚Äúthat conservative buzzword that people keep throwing around to scare ignorant people‚Äù. I‚Äôve never heard anyone actually refer to themselves as a socialist in real life because they‚Äôre pro free healthcare and etc, and why would they when the word is so loaded and misused today? Why would anyone attach that label to themselves willingly right now? All it does is give idiots an opening to say ‚ÄúSeE?! ThEy ARE sOciALiStS!‚Äù and dismiss them.   Hold on now, that's not fair, they don't ""want people to suffer."" They just don't consider you ""people"" if you're below a certain income level.   No, socialism is collective ownership of the means of production, which would cause those two things not to exist. Any way you want to cut it, Sweden is a free market capitalist nation with good social programs.   That's nothing. Someone is named Fucking Cocksucker. Their friend left a colorful letter complimenting their parking skills. They accidentally left the note on my car though. We must drive similar cars.

Honestly though. You‚Äôd have a better chance moving to a place that runs the way you‚Äôd like then changing all of America into socialism.   This is what NATO is.  An organization formed by these free European countries to protect themselves from communist aggression.   Perhaps you've not seen the price of college and housing in Canada?   
The health care is sweet though.   There was barely any socialism in the soviet union
It was a state capitalism   Imagine thinking the opposite of socialism is fascism   I‚Äôm 35, so at the higher end of the millennial age spectrum, and I was fucking four when the Berlin Wall fell. The USSR and the Cold War were boogeymen that our parents constantly referenced as the enemy, all the while buying houses they couldn‚Äôt fucking afford and telling us we had to go to college or amount to nothing. And then graduated college right as a recession began and was told by this same fucking generation that caused the recession that we have it easy.   Maybe, and hear me out, this meme is about both generations not understanding what socialism is?   [removed]   Stfu bro. How the fuck do you come to the conclusion that Switzerland handled the second wave worse than *the USA*? Switzerland has [6.4 deaths related to corona per 100k inhabitants](https://www.bag.admin.ch/dam/bag/de/dokumente/mt/k-und-i/aktuelle-ausbrueche-pandemien/2019-nCoV/covid-19-woechentlicher-lagebericht.pdf.download.pdf/BAG_COVID-19_Woechentliche_Lage.pdf), whereas the state with the LOWEST death rate in the US (Vermont) already has [18 deaths per 100k inhabitants.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/) 

Corrupt as fuck? What? Where the fricking hell did you get that information from? Here in Switzerland, *every* little change has to be approved by both the Swiss people and the cantons. Thus, there is no way Swiss politicians can change something in favour of their ""financiers"", if they're corrupt as you call them. They can suggest something and try to get 100k signatures by citizens entitled to vote, but they won't get far...   Their stupidity is already leaking into Canada.   The thing is. It isn‚Äôt socialism   No you wouldn't have. Unless you're scum without a job and able to get citizenship in 4 fucking years you moron.   [removed]   ""Humor""   Never been to California, Arizona or Florida so it sounds like I'm not the one you have beef with.

Never said it was special either. Like many places we  have what is considered to be some pretty basic human quality of life.   Please don't discourage them   What‚Äôs my fixation?   Yeah, millennials don't know what socialism is if that's the case...   She's beloved Aunty Becky. That's why.   I enjoy it here. Winter isn‚Äôt bad   They did a study once in which they show people in uniforms saying lies and people believe it without questioning because apparently if you paste ""there is a study that shows..."" it makes it look more realistic   Switzerland lol   You can‚Äôt rebrand something that already has a name. Its a social democracy   You‚Äôre gonna have to fill me in on how pardons are reversible. 

My point is that the checks and balances do nothing to stop a criminal, incompetent president; but they sure will stop health care and gun control.   [deleted]   Safe space needing snowflakes    So there are about 67,500 animators and you still can't find a job with healthcare?   Students and low income people can get ask the goverment to pay their healthcare insurance.   Move the goal posts?  They gave factually incorrect information.  OSAP is not free, it's a loan, and you have to start paying it like 6 months out of school even if you don't have a job.  It is interest free if you're paying it, but if you don't have a job and can't afford payments, you then start collecting interest.

Also, scholarships are not a unique thing to Canada, so that's a stupid point to try and say school is free in Canada.  The US also has scholarships, scholarships which also have nothing to do with the country or the government.

Yet again Americans knowing nothing about Canadian systems and saying uniformed stupid things.   Socialism ‚â† canada   American politics have gotten weird man   Yo this is stupid as fuck.   Then in that case they are also capitalist countries.

It‚Äôs mixed. If you‚Äôre going to say that it‚Äôs socialist because they have socialist policies one could say the same about them being capitalist.

Would you like that repeated a third time?   [removed]   Wait, Narnia doesn‚Äôt exist?

Where does Game of Thrones take place then?   Imagine thinking.   Not much different than asking a European the difference between Montana and Kentucky.   Biden won, leave already!   Russian trolls like you need to stop interfering.   You're still moving the goalpost. You didn't say ""your system of checks and balance is flawed"" You said our entire checks and balances system is bullshit and that we live in an ""oligarchy."" There's a world of difference between those two points. 

I like how you literally bring up that the senate and the Supreme Court can undermine Biden's future power, even though that's literally a sign of our checks and balances not giving too much power to an individual, and working as intended somewhat. It's not perfect by anymeans, but you were arguing it was flat-out non functional, which is a lie.   Affordable housing.... Canada?   I actually agree with that really hard, but I think abortion is a really bad example. Both republicans and democrats will happily agree that some federal limitations are good, for example murder. If you agree that a fetus is a human life (you don't have to agree with that), but if you did, it's not a huge stretch to say well taking a human life is not legal therefore abortion should not be legal (again I disagree with this argument, just trying to reasonably understand the strongest possible argument of people I disagree with)

The flipside could be something along the lines of a minimum wage. If you've ever lived in a city you will know that 7.25 an hour is comically low and not at all acceptable for life in such a place, but 15 an hour would be comically high and impose insurmountable obstacles to small businesses in most of the geographic area of the country. We could potentially get into where the federal minimum would be, but generally I would argue for heavily localized minimum wages.   Socialism? Switzerland? Canada? As a canadian in my twenties, I think this generation lost the meaning of socialism. I mean at least talk about scandinavia or something.   Source? Russia has awful universal healthcare with dated equipment in their hospitals.

The US has among the best doctors and hospitals in the world, although the debt you get in is literally enough to make plenty of people risk their lives to avoid the ambulance   I think the question is, could you have formed this opinion from the sound bites you've been shown about her? Or from the MASSIVE press of *other people's opinion* that rides on top of those sound bites?

This is the thing about misinformation. We can totally see it when others have been influenced, but we're simultaneously DEAD CERTAIN that our opinions are our own.   Just wait for the ICE agents to come to you, no?   Was this the country that supported Nazi Germany?   Unless she posted it and deleted it, it's not real. I doubt that she would ever drop an F bomb in a format that would tarnish her aire of decorum. I think she probably dropped quite a few in private after the tryst in the oval office was made public.   I don't need it.  I think gauging by income is a silly way to do it.  I was all for increasing unemployment benefits, as that seems to go to those who were most impacted.  And I think there should be a method by which independent contractors can get unemployment benefits, despite not normally being eligible.   Sorry Trump supporters have lives and jobs. We will move on with our lives regardless who is in office. The irony of the left who for weeks after the 2016 election bitched and moaned and made threats to leave the country.   As is most of the planet. Great job

‚ÄúAmericans are so dumb‚Äù

*makes a joke back*

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get defensive jeez‚Äù

Lol moron   [deleted]   Socialist*ic* is different from Socialist...   socialism does not have to be a transitional state.  You saying it IS the transitional state shows that you have already confirmed your bias. 

That's like saying money leads to corruption, this does not have to be true, we/you have a possibility to change that. It is not static.   Canada and Switzerland are highly taxed capitalist economies . Nothing socialist about them .   The benefits come from taxes and are not free.   We need both democrats to win to get to tie breaker...I'm praying for that.   Moving the goal posts as in, you ask super specific questions. They give you answers. Immediately after that it's ""But what about this now?""

My point is, it doesn't matter what responses you get, you aren't going to acknowledge what they told you, just move on to something new. 

You did a good job with it here, with me.   Lol what? So only the specific words of Jesus are fair game and the remaining 95% of the Bible is rubbish or worth less? That's such an absolutely ludicrous argument. Where did I claim that my verse absolves me of any commandments? Furthermore, my point is that Jesus's story where he tells that specific individual to give up his wealth wasn't a commandment and reading it as such is a faulty interpretation of that text. Kings David and Solomon were extremely wealthy and entered into heaven. Were they not real christians? 

Your verse also doesn't prove OP's point, and you also conveniently leave off the following two verses to make your point.  

25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, ‚ÄúWho then can be saved?‚Äù

26 Jesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄúWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.‚Äù 

Again, Jesus is saying that through our own works it is impossible to enter the kingdom of Heaven, however, through the grace of God you can.   Taxation  above  50%
Big  specific  difference   I‚Äôm not moving any goalposts. I‚Äôm telling you that you idiots think the checks and balances exist to protect you, but what they really do is protect the oligarchy and minority rule.

Is your government completely non-functional? No? But if you had a parliamentary system, you‚Äôd have health care and gun control in two months.

Meanwhile, Trump ran roughshod with no consequences. Nice system dude.   Yes, outside the US where we‚Äôve got around to it. The political sphere within the US is something else.   Funny how your rapid-fire responses suddenly ceased when presented with new information that you didn't know about, but sure acted like you did.   This guys a loser   1500 bucks for my basement I put a hot plate in.   The Germans tried, but somebody had to interfere. I am not blaming you.   you want the iranians to die laughing   [deleted]   Let's face it, the whole reason America didn't like socialism is because it doesn't line American's pockets.   Go read your own posts, it's like you only have 10 ideas, that you apply to every life situation and they're all generalizations about one thing or another.   I do! That's where denim comes from!"
PremierLeague,2021,"  It isn‚Äôt even properly consistent though ‚Äî several years ago Suarez got suspended for 8 games, then this time Cavani got 3 games... which reveals that the FA knows deep down that context DOES matter... and yet the rich English institution of power chose to punish the recent immigrant anyway, just for harmlessly using a term of endearment in his own native language, because it sounds similar to a word that makes people think of England‚Äôs own history of themselves committing moral atrocities.

The English FA are being the real racists here, and they‚Äôre projecting their own country‚Äôs history of racism onto a Spanish term... just because it might make the rich English institution of power look bad when a third world immigrant who works for them used it (even though this case was obviously in a wholesome context).

The shameless hypocrisy of rich Englishmen virtue signaling about racial justice by punishing a foreigner who has only been there for two months is absolutely mind-boggling!

Stay neutral if you want ‚Äî the right to remain silent is absolutely essential for basically the same reasons as freedom of speech ‚Äî but anybody who actively claims that the FA‚Äôs real motivation was social justice in this Cavani case specifically is just being willfully ignorant   It's a spanish word, misused in English. They just ban the only way to refer to the color black in spanish, and guess what Spanish is the third spoken  language in the world. Cavani was not talking to an english speaker, he was talking to another spanish speaker, that happens to be nicknamed Black. Disney got The Black Pearl movie and no one complains of the name being racist. Why on earth will someone complain of using the same word in spanish by a spanish speaker talking to another spanish speaker. I would be fine with the racist ban if he was talking to an english speaker. By banning the word they just banned a whole language, since they don't give a crap about the origin of the word or its uses in it's original language. It's a joke."
badeconomics,2021,"  Point 1: Organising production within firms will lead to lower costs of monitoring

I agree with this completely, the point which is being made is that i) that is not complete explanation of organization of work ii) the costs which incurred within internal procurement is not being attended too.

Point 2: Coasian Transaction costs vs Hierarchy

&gt; All of the things you list in the first part of your message look to me like justifications for Coaseian transaction costs, not arguments against the idea.

The point here is simple. Various institutional responses (public, private, cultural) arise when transaction costs are high leading to markets dis appearing. 
As it turns out one of this institutional responses when information and knowledge costs are high is Hierarchy/authority/dominance, given the technological level in society and initial allocation of wealth. *It is because of transaction costs that hierarchy is an institutional response.*
 
Point 3:

&gt; On the other hand, are you really saying that hierachy actually is inherent in the idea of division-of-Labour? Now, I have had a look at some of your posting history. Don't you think that's a bit of a hot-take for a hard leftist? Think of the implications.

I am glad you asked this question, it is not a hot take at all not if you understand the reason behind it.

The reason why it is claimed that, division of labour will lead to hierarchy, is because as people specialize, they acquire tacit knowledge about the world. Now while transacting with one another because they are **opportunistic** (they key point in Oliver Williamson's work) they use it strategically resulting in market failure. Thus hierarchy arises of this market failure.

Leftism seeks to bring about within humans, changes in moral character, which makes them (towards each other) more trusting, caring and egalitarian (actual econo/anthropological evidence suggest that they are given circumstances); within such a society there will be no or little opportunism. No ex post moral hazard, no ex ante adverse selection. 

Trust/ egalitarianism replace hierarchy/authority/monitoring as the cultural institutional responses which allow division of labour to flourish.

Second point if you read carefully, the result in the first part of my post depends on a key assumption:

&gt; The problem is, if the worker has constant absolute risk aversion &gt;0 or has a limited liability constraint or generally risk averse, no first best contract is possible the principal faces a risk incentive trade off.

See the principal agent problem has a simple non hierarchic and first best solution, the agent basically ""buys out the firm"". But for that the agent has to be risk neutral. It is precisely because a large portion of current society (there is term for this) is risk averse, they depend on their salary to put food on the table thus hierarchic responses are required."

*This is an automated message.*   No you're right, as he is a top 500 earner in the country. So 10x less taxes than earnings   Yes   Why not specify that in the title then rather than suggesting something widespread with ""media""?   Managed to find some more (2012 Lotus and 2015 Mercedes). Download them soon, as I am not sure how long will these links work.  


Lewis Hamilton W06 Mercedes (2015): [https://www.datasheetarchive.com/whats\_new/7549c076027b42280b146c86c4a7300f.html](https://www.datasheetarchive.com/whats_new/7549c076027b42280b146c86c4a7300f.html)

Lotus E20 (2012): [https://www.liam27.com/stuff/Lotus-E20-template.pdf](https://www.liam27.com/stuff/Lotus-E20-template.pdf)   Still have all of the Americas, lol   This is me even when simracing in vr lol. It's so weird feeling adrenaline, and getting weak knees while sitting at my desk... I can't imagine how it feels having to hit the brakes on the back straight and hit the apex of parabolica while strapped to a fucking high downforce rocket of a car   Love your profile pic :)   He‚Äôs like a little Aussie Ewok   Exactly.   G R E E N   Just found the Lotus E20 as well. I posted links to it and Mercdes ones in separate comment.   Haha lmao   Why are your assuming that you could do what France does without the monarchy? Monarchy just doesn't form a big part of French tourism, while it's fundamental to British tourism.   Everyone knows you can replace every letter S with √ü and it is german /s   Very very niiiiiiice   Doesn‚Äôt make sense.   Now do the one for 90% of the Reddit users cheering Sir Tax Dodger in here and claiming to be left wing in other threads.   Post Removal

*This is an automated message.*   Yes - it includes legislation such as the HRA, Devolution Acts and ECA, case law such as Rahmatullah, Case of Prohibitions and Entick v Carrington and conventions such as the Ministerial Code and Erskine May among many many other things. All written down, but in different places, these make up the UK‚Äôs constitution.   Fair enough. Maybe I have too much ‚Äùliking‚Äù to Bottas. I realize Valtteri won‚Äôt challenge for WDC unless Sir Lewis does a ‚ÄùMSC 1999 Silverstone‚Äù. I just don‚Äôt want Russell to get completely destroyed. But yeah, I mean your argument is superior, I admit.   [deleted]   Ya, I hate roads!   The Americas are only like 13% of the world population   Italy has it

France has a similar thing   Incognito ü§î   Dislike/disagree with something that happens to a black guy? You racist!!!

Can we not have opinions anymore?   Hey it's skinny Vin Diesel.   You ""honestly"" don't understand citizenship? He is born in Germany, his mother is German and he grew up speaking German as his native language. 

What level of Germanness is required for someone to pass your purity test?   Many British famous driver avoid tax man. Hamilton also avoid tax man. Other famous British driver get knighthood and whatever the other honors are despite avoiding tax man. Hamilton hasn't gotten it yet, people think racism is the cause   I just jump to the conclusion we will 110% get a nice racing green   I‚Äôd love to see that one post.   Not gonna lie, I‚Äôd love to see it.   This. He was overdue, if anything.   He's only getting hate because he supported an anti racist cause... making it totally not about racism. Really?   Not really its a public course so perfect for a quick hit with mates. Not something they would ever hold a competition at or anything"

|^[bot-script](https://github.com/f1uk3r/Some-Python-Scripts/blob/master/reddit-nba-bot/reddit-boxscore-bot.py) ^by ^/u/f1uk3r|    Wtf   fine with me   Here is a [Gfycat mirror of this Streamable link](https://gfycat.com/ColorlessIndolentIchthyostega)

If the link doesn't work, please wait a few minutes for the gfycat to be ready.   Responding to what was clearly a joke with this level of salt isn‚Äôt the way to go about it, bud lol   Hell Australia is already in 2021, Ben in 2021 form already   [removed]   [deleted]   Lookin like a revenge revenge game   need a lardbiscuits vs fultzshoulders rap battle.   Biased but very same   Not really. You see how open he is in this clip? This shot was basically a glorified shoot around shot cuz no one is even near him. All he has to do is make the defense respect the three.   Haha. I love Stacey King   [deleted]   Wow. The memories that just came flooding back.   Good luck nba lmao THE BUFFALO IS FREE   I love it. Make him earn that shit and I‚Äôm happy to see how Wendell reacted. Grooowwwwwth baby.   I missed it because I was shocked by the MF Doom news :((   because he's a bad shooter   https://youtu.be/CZ_7dERUU7E   Yeah bruv. People look at him leading his 1-3 squad and look at his stats and think...Yeah...MVP   Nothing but net every time.   [removed]   /r/nba: Kyrie is an idiot. 

Also /r/nba: uhh, he donates money to charity.  You can‚Äôt criticize rich people if they give a small portion of their money to charity. 

ALSO /r/nba: I‚Äôm literally thousands of anonymous people with different opinions discussing news on an Internet forum and i didn‚Äôt say either of those things. 

Here comes r/nba with the: I‚Äôm smarter than all the other idiots on r/nba even though I‚Äôm also posting nonsense on r/nba.   You must have a sweet ass investment portfolio thanks to Wu-Tang Financials.   [deleted]   if Stanley johnson gets more than 2 minutes of play time I'm driving down to Tampa and slapping Nick Nurse   If anything, the fact that fact that a clip of him making a 3 gets upvoted to high heaven really is an indictment of how low the bar is for Ben Simmons. It‚Äôs kinda sad, honestly.   They will fire him after this game no matter the result and will bring Kenny Atkinson   Ben like Harden who? Lol   You heard that Bulls fans?

He told y‚Äôall to shut up   [removed]   People seriously say he can‚Äôt draft well?   Relax man it‚Äôs NYE have some champagne, the mean sixers fans won‚Äôt hurt you tonight   3 for 28... don't tell hawks fans   [removed]   [deleted]   not really. My classmates in HS who are into chess always are better than me in the game but I totally destroy them in Math and other science subjects. 

Good chess players are definitely intelligent but I would say its not always proportional in terms of intelligence in other things.   Sexland was great, need to see Okoro and KPJ with those two and then we might be onto something. If we could get someone like Mobley or maybe even Kuminga(the question becomes who comes off the bench between Sexton, Garland, and KPJ in that case) and everyone else keeps developing we might have a damn good squad   There are two wolves inside of you.   Nice touch OKC for including the message in te reo at the end   this is the beginning of the end of the league   Straight dicked on him. He has a family Jo   Congrats OP, this is going to r/all   You can always count on Boston sports fans to make literally everything about themselves...   If Harden drops another video game trip dub on NYE, 2021 will be saved.   This might be off topic, but can I ask why when the Rockets players had to sit out due to health and safety protocols, they were called idiots, but no one said that about Caruso? We gotta stop shaming players for having to sit out, a lot of them are going to have to sit out due to contact tracing this year even if they never actually did anything extremely risky. As long as someone they met has met someone with COVID, they will need to be out for a while.   rip DOOM tho   I hope that happens because he would shut up people that need to realize he can't shoot, there is a reason he doesn't take them, poor FT% and poor mid range shooter, and people want him to start shooting

Why?   Oof, big blow. He was a beast against the Celtics in the last couple games.   Fuck Mitch McConnell.   No bias but I think once we got kd that was the most impressive and difficulty earned championship.mavs second   [deleted]   man sometimes sports is really disheartening lol

Like I know that this is only hilarious because of the context, but even with context sometimes seeing 22 described as ""old"" makes me feel like my life is already over lmao

Obviously I know it's not old, but then I think about how much further ahead these guys are in life than me personally already and it's just like fuck bring on that good ol existential crisis   How was my response salty lmao it was a joke...   popcorn.gif   Where are you?   that's.....what he just said.   No matter how many times I've seen that picture, it never fails to make me chuckle. Your brain keeps telling you it has to be a tiny prop can or something and just can't comprehend that he was the same species. That or the clip from one of the early Wrestlemania's where he choked Bob Uecker and his hands were still like halfway down his chest! That and Bob is 6'1"" so it's not like they brought a little dude out for comedic effect for the scene.   Oh I agree. Which is why I wanted some clarification. If I can have a Simmons who shoots twice as much I'm going to take that every time. Not saying he is a great or even good shooter, but his not shooting is more of an issue than him being bad at it.   Yeah I think people have super extreme takes on Danny Ainge for no reason. 

Celtics fans seem to think he's a historically elite GM, while haters try to paint him as this bumbling idiot who wouldn't trade Terry Rozier for Kawhi Leonard (that didn't happen). 

The truth is probably somewhere in between, he clearly very sharp at some things, and probably behind the curve in other ways, so overall that nets out to average-ish overall impact.   Simmons, Fultz, ?   could get ahead of Ewing and Hayes for sure   Fuck Mitch McConnell!   ‚ÄúTrae ‚ÄúAdolf Hitler‚Äù Young‚Äù   He's definitely a problem. He's putting up almost 20 shots a game with an efg% of .422, which is dreadful. It's the worst of his career outside of his rookie year.   Lol nah. Dude gets exposed because teams realize he can‚Äôt shoot.   but he was good last game

we didn't lose because of him   this is one of the few arguments where ill always side with lal fans   Must have a master's at this point right   Exactly which is why it's being an edgelord   We want the funk   I thought so too for a long time, but now I think he may have the yips. Against Toronto the other night, they had this exact same setup as his shot tonight, but he kind of froze and took too long and the defense closed on him. I hope this gives him the confidence he needs to put it up without thinking about it.   LEAGUE STATUS: FUCKED

TRADE RUMORS FOR HARDEN: STOPPED

CHAMPIONSHIP: UNLOCKED   How many ECF‚Äôs has he made?   Not too familiar with the narrative that Ainge can't draft.  I think he has done a pretty good job with his picks and you do a good job of pointing out some of the flaws. The Tatum/Fultz trade made him look pretty genius.

I think at this point he gets more flack for his lack of loyalty to players. The  Isaiah Thomas trade and other things I read about him not being loyal to players (I think Kemba Walker has been a recent one).  The Paul Pierce trade was probably a smart move, but will always feel a little wrong to me.   is hachimura on a minutes restriction or something?   tross is the MVP we suck without him lol   One thing I just realized I miss: seeing Russ hype up a crowd.   [deleted]   this is now the craziest thing to happen in 2020...kiddin   he was 2/24 in his career prior to this one

Let 'em fly, Ben!   he attempted and missed one first game   I think he'd have to win at least 2 rings to do so. That's a hard list to crack. I think one ring gets him passed that Karl Malone/Pat Ewing tier if he continues his production. Two could solidify it.   Ah yes, the annual Ben 3 point shot that goes to r/all.   Because Kyries PR people tell him to and he can get insider info from them.   He's pretty good at french horn. Better than Eric.   [removed]   [deleted]   No. They are far too important in the ""makes miami heat fans freakout"" department to not let them play against them.   if shootaround shots translated to games reliably Dwight would be an 80% free throw shooter   The most confusing shit ever fr. Like I understood why Markelle didn‚Äôt wanna shoot when he was us, his form was atrocious and he got clowned. Bens form isn‚Äôt *good* but it‚Äôs not like cringe inducing when just watching a game on the broadcast ya know   2020 truly is the most unbelievable year   Please dont compare luka and hardens bodies lol   He doesn't mean nobody cares, moreso he looks forward to the day when nobody has to care because it's seen as commonplace for women to have just as much success as men in coaching positions.

That's currently not the case now, but he is looking forward to the day when that is true, he just kind of worded it in a wierd way   Be safe   The Sixers could have in 2019 but ran into the eventual champions   ...off the court when Haliburton takes his ankles   I‚Äôm so proud *sheds tear*   I'm very much a Celtics homer but come on, Tatum &gt; Ben easily   LEAN IN MY CUP

GAS IN MY BLUNT   Harden O/U 40 today?   [removed]   Here to watch Wall and someone named Haliburton that Kings fans are hyping up   Pain. We have to be the most injured team in the last 5-10 years. Whenever the ball gets rolling, you can count on a big injury.   WHAT HE CANT SHOOT?!?!??!!   We got a shooter now!   Lmao rightfully so, he's a dirty ass player and a whiny bitch on top of it. He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt.   Ben in regular season: 16/8/8/2 on .577 TS% 

Playoffs: 15/8/7/2  .581 TS%   Here is a [Gfycat mirror of this Streamable link](https://gfycat.com/InexperiencedUnacceptableIchthyostega)

If the link doesn't work, please wait a few minutes for the gfycat to be ready.   Lmao seriously though, I read this tweet and said ‚Äúof fucking course he broke his nose‚Äù. He gets hit in the face more than a boxer.   Oooo just posting to see if i am a longterm good standing member   MVP   Shades of Shaq   I remember reading a thread and tweet about Fultz had figured it out. Not watching the game but that‚Äôs a sad Q1 stat line   Facts. Anyone can go the gym and work on their offensive game. Defense needs a whole 5v5 to practice   It was a joke but ok. Seems like you guys are more sensitive about us then we are about you lmao   I‚Äôm def feeling better about our loss to the clips.   Probably UK or Ireland. 5 hours ahead. Rest of Western Europe is 6 hours   yep, different foot   then they start shitting on him like they do with russ   League is soooo fucked   Nothing but net   I know everyone roots for fultz and all that jazz but im a shameless asshole from philly and I love watching him suck now that he's not a sixer.   Fultz with the monster first quarter üò§üò§üòàüòà

Four shots that almost went in.

Nice go see the improvement from the young fella   Why does it feel like Scott Brooks refuses to pay Beal and Westbrook together?   Magic, kobe and shaq have nothing to do with this. I‚Äôm specifically talking about the era you gave shitty contracts out after kobe left. Meanwhile the Celtics completed the greatest steal of a trade and were contending while also rebuilding.   We gave the world Mike Pence. This is the universe‚Äôs way of punishing us.   For what? It was a joke.   Seth Curry looking over at Ben during practice like ‚Äúthis dude better not dig into my minutes...‚Äù   My point was that it makes no sense to shoot them in shoot around if he does plan on it in the game.   Y‚Äôall were in the league then too why didn‚Äôt you win those titles then   *Lawwwwry*   He really doesn't want to be traded.   So no drop off? That‚Äôs a good thing   Agree entirely. The ""KD established himself as being (even arguably) the worlds best player on the warriors"" take is honestly the most braindead shit I hear on here and espn.   *The Thunder enter the chat*

""How many first rounders you got?""   Joel EmBEAST   I‚Äôve never see embiid fuck vooch like this before   That's just the way he looks. He trains hard (and parties hard too evidently) every off season.   [removed]   What's her name tho   It‚Äôs funny imagining Japanese announcers yelling ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù when an Americans score

and no, not just because they‚Äôre not great at pronouncing ‚ÄúL‚Äù sounds   How is that relevant?   Yeah but they didn‚Äôt did they?   [deleted]   [deleted]   [removed]   Lmao giannis really hates harden fr   And they say a hero can save us...they are right.   same here lol   Nurse is starting Powell in place of Siakam?   Shai vs NAW. All the marbles   I think Coby White has the record for most in a quarter, with 7 in the 4th against the Knicks. He had none in the other 3 so it was still 7 globaly.   [removed]   The Lakers claim 6 from dudes who‚Äôs numbers they won‚Äôt retire   Not sure thats true for our team   How are you getting downvoted lol   Shoot, I forgot about that   If we lose here, then the Florida Curse is real.   Fuck your fantasy team   https://streamable.com/a0hmwi Here‚Äôs the landscape video   im not sure i was probbaly 50 years away from being born bro   Let's go, Bulls. For the memes!   Spain and Portugal are also possible, no?   Throw batteries until he hits them consistently   Yea but that team was better than any Jayson Tatum era Celtics team...   Harden without PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon so strange... The 3 deserved a ring though   I might argue its lose-lose...   [removed]   [removed]   I know I might get downvoted....but I kind of like that Miami team! Great 'villian' for the NBA! So weird for me to cheer for a powerful team while everyone I knew hated them!   super happy to see this as the top comment, because that was my exact initial reaction lol. cringey as fuck. 

some people don't realize that the equivalent would be someone exclaiming ""HELLO"" when you accomplished something simply because it's english, and hey that's where you're from! it's funny now, but less funny the 100000th time and more demeaning or condescending.   I feel like giannis started it too which seems out of character for him üòÇ   Bephan   lol no, PG's leg snapped in half and he came back and ended up 3rd in MVP voting for a season and people clown him all the time, why give the snake sympathy?   Yeah it‚Äôs Ireland   Demar said he chose not to shoot threes for the same reason so that might not be far off   What a dumb pass   [deleted]   I 100% agree with everything you're saying here.   Still 6 hours for Spain. Time zones are weird. But yes Portugal is 5 ahead of est. I stand corrected.   That would be an incredible hire.   mods removed two of these i posted, they hate the sixers :(   [deleted]   I asked because we already have 1 AM   When Cole was at UNC, he‚Äôd go to parties and just sit on the couch the entire time looking very bored.   [deleted]   I wouldn‚Äôt call it a good or bad thing, I would call it no drop off.   On another note, Fuck Mitch McConnell   UNTOUCHABLE IN ANY TRADE   Just cuz your mom cheated doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else‚Äôs did too   Bertans in his own head   **Replays/alternate angles**

Free throws are also free but there are people making them at 90% in practice but 50% in game   [removed]   [deleted]   Bertans looking like he finnesed a bag   [removed]   We look incredible rn lol   because he's practicing them but is not good enough to shoot them in games   MVP is a lock now!   He babied vuc in that first qtr   It‚Äôs an automatic good thing because playoff games are more intense and the schemes and defences are more on point   Yet they didn‚Äôt get as far as the Celtics have done in nearly every season Tatum‚Äôs played    Best play I‚Äôve seen so far this season   I literally cringed when I heard KONICHIWA. Glad this is the top comment   ben simmons shooting 100% from 3   Contracts are always tradable if they become a hindrance.   [Your Japanese is awful.](https://youtu.be/ZcD75L4QLrM?t=19)   i'm a bucks fan and i agree. the bulls have very good commentators. I also remember liking the nets and kings commentators in terms of teams that I'm not a fan of.   one quarter doesn‚Äôt change the previous 4 games lol   This completely ruined my day. That family has been through the wringer.   Stopping on a dime is actually smart, it's absolutely not like Harden.   Yes, but age and contract are also factors.   https://youtu.be/xwJdubNYcks

Honestly watch this and honestly say he doesn't have amazing post moves and the best footwork.   Fuck Dwight Howard, all my homies hate Dwight Howard   I've been watching him a bit this year. He looks bad today but has looked good the rest of the season so far. I wonder if maybe its just because he's playing us, IDK. He looks off   Haliburton the goat?   Alternative universe: Ben Just starts saying fuck it and jacking up 9 a game at 15% with everyone just begging him to stop shooting!   No hesitation üò§   Nah lol like a year or two ago a mod one night decided to go power happy and basically deleted anything whatsoever on new that had to do with the Lakers and 76ers (mostly cause they were playing at the time) and I believe also remove comments from basically anyone that went against their view, and at the time people assumed it was the lone Celtics mod on the team since it was targeting Lakers/76ers highlights and posts.

There was a whole mod post about it and they specifically said it wasn't the Celtics mod since by then 90% of the sub thought it was and was calling him out, and that the mod in question (they never said who) had been removed/reprimanded.

Now... People either just embrace the meme of it all or still truly believe it cause they never saw the post or think the mods were hiding him, lol.   I feel like people are missing the reference of when Ibaka made him eat bull penis on his YouTube channel   Really arguing about who‚Äôs the better loser. Fascinating   His form is atrocious.   I agree!   Here are the players who efficiency and productivity dont decrease:
LeBron, AD, CP3, Kawhi, Butler, Jokic, Murray.

In 2013, James Harden went from 25.9 ppg on 44/37 splits on .600 TS to 26.3 ppg on 39/34 splits on .548 TS.

In 2014, Harden went from  25.4 ppg on 46/37 splits on .618 TS to 26.8 ppg on 38/30 splits on .519 TS.

In 2015, Harden went from 27.4 ppg on 44/38 splits on .605 TS to 27.2 ppg on 44/38 splits on .620 TS.

In 2016 Harden went from 29.0 ppg on 44/36 splits on .598 TS to 26.6 ppg on 41/31 splits on .555 TS.

In 2017 Harden went from 29.1 ppg on 44/35 splits on .613 TS to 28.5 ppg to 41/28 splits on .583 TS.

In 2018 Harden went from 30.4 ppg on 45/37 splits on .619 TS to 28.6 ppg on 41/30 splits on .548 TS.

In 2019 Harden went from 36.1 ppg on 44/37 splits on .616 TS to 31.6 ppg on 41/35 splits on .557 TS.

In 2020 Harden went from 34.3 ppg on 44/36 splits on .626 TS to 29.6 ppg on 48/33 splits on .636 TS.

Idk which Harden youre looking at, but only in 2 out if the 8 posteeasons as a Rocket did Harden stay consistent/improve on efficiency. All the other postseasons he has had precipitous drops in efficiency and/or productivity.   Who would curse the Indiana Pacers of all teams   Bitch McCuntell   ""oh boy I get to go home early""   ***DEAR DIARY.....ITS HAPPENING...***   Moreyball in action   **Replays/alternate angles**

If the link doesn't work, please wait a few minutes for the gfycat to be ready.   MO!   Fuck Mitch McConnell   We really do go as he goes, even with how consistent Vuc is   Not really   my dick is Harden   Harden plz...   plot twist, he get an open 3 for the win because everybody is guarding Boban   So you are claiming it‚Äôs solely because of Tatum?   Thank you, kings.   Fuck Mitch McConnell!   mods removed this twice already lol what gives   Nurse is not fucking around - I love this.   Damn. Did you hire our medical staff or something?   Yes but the percentages are part of the context.   lol you guys sound so desperate to trade him   Oh my god, they might make a few million less. Now I understand!   Sixers legends MCW and Fultz.

I think this is the first time I've seen MCW almost look like an adult. He's looked 14 since he got into the league.   I listened to him on JJ‚Äôs pod and man I just hated all of that. He made it seem like he didn‚Äôt shoot 3s out of some sort of respect for the old game. Very close to straight up acknowledging that his game would be better if he did shoot them.

Actually enjoyed his comment on basically everything else. But that did not sit well with me.   TJ (unless you give him time to place and load up the trebuchet)   [deleted]   I would have left Siakam in the bubble with Quinn Cook he almost looked like me in the celtics series   [removed]   He's not in game shape. He will be fine in 5-10 games.   He's with the clippers now tho? Can you hire away an assistant mid season?   Nah I'm fine with being last on the bench.   there‚Äôs barely any fans and they still boo dwight, lmao gotta love it   Hitting 41% of your pull up 3s like he did last yr is hard as hell for anybody to sustain even the best shooters.   [removed]   How many have the Lakers won over the past 30 years? What about all the other franchises?   That was fucking beautiful   [deleted]   Am I the only one who does not find them saying ""Konichiwa"" cringe?   He was a decent passer   Ya‚Äôll been warned!!   Embiid is looking like an MVP contender so far   Seth Curry=Best Curry   You‚Äôre correct. The other guys are just dense lmao   Tbh you‚Äôre probably right. He loves the spotlight and unfortunately thinks he‚Äôs Kobe. He‚Äôs a good player, solid all around, but he loves himself some highlight plays and that causes a lot of tunnel vision.   I'd be happy if he went off every game and then laid some eggs against the Sixers.   &gt;Simmons could become Jordan 2.0 and they still wouldn‚Äôt be able to come back from that. 

Lol glad you're here to make this decision   Damn siakam playing that bad?   I dunno I love when our announcers scream BONJOUR when Boucher hits a three lol   The media are pawns anyway. Why does Russ have to be nice to them? &gt;!/s!&lt;   These refs are booty. Both teams have had some terrible calls against them.   Skull grip reminds me of Kurrgan in WWF   This is the bench time rn and our bench has been so bad that he's staggering them.   a megagiga cherry picked stat that leads to about 0 meaningles comments, not sure.   [removed]   is siakam injured   Siakam is just not playing well rn   If they‚Äôre trading both OG and Siakam what‚Äôs the point?  You can‚Äôt just trot out harden plus the g-league and expect to be any good.   Will they try to ban it at some point, if he's just fully taking the piss?   Problem with r/nba in general when it comes to the Pacers is that no one watches them or pays attention to them, so we're just an afterthought when it comes it predictions.

""Oh yeah, the Pacers exist, let's stick them somewhere around the 6-8 seed and move on to the more exciting teams""

It's understandable, since we don't have a superstar and haven't made noise in the playoffs in a while, but also frustrating as a Pacers fan to see one's team constantly overlooked. 

Tl;dr: [Hibbert the philosopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSX-7eHf3tI)   *Don't think, just pitch!*

Nuke Laloosh, Bull Durham   splitting hairs but japanese people are not ‚Äúnot great‚Äù at pronouncing L sounds, lots of japanese words have a hard L in them. it‚Äôs just hard for them when having to pronounce L‚Äôs in english bc the L will be in a weird spot in the word. ik you weren‚Äôt being disrespectful or anything but it‚Äôs a falsehood to say they‚Äôre bad at L sounds   [deleted]   It's just one time for me because I haven't stopped since 2011   im sorry were a born on 3rd base franchise...what do u want me to do? lol   No. Powell would be a trade chip for salary.   At the same time 4 games don't change the previous 60+   We saw a unicorn   EVERYBODY GET IN HERE   EVERYOME GET IN HERE   He shouldn't be. I think Brooks just sucks.   [deleted]   here for history haha   GOT SOME HOES WHO GON FUCK   John Wall and Boogie having fun before the game https://twitter.com/RenzoTheDon/status/1344796412303855616?s=19   lol   [removed]   Nah that was all referee induced.   190 million is an expensive 6th man   The Lakers won rings, became trash, rebuilt, won again, and are likely to win more.

All in a span where the Celtics didn't win a single ring. Nothing. Just ""accumulating assets"". 

I don't think this is the era you want to take victory laps on.   NO FUCK THE PACERS   Oh, so y'all know about his wierd grudge too?

He's a real joy to have in our sub, lemme tell ya   That's what I'm saying. Like no 5 o clock shadow or anything   Too funny. 10/10 would hang with Brooke to not talk any basketball but just clown on guys   we don't have the privilege to randomly attract superstars based entirely on our location   he's on a different team and youre still hating on him

love the commitment   [deleted]   I mean I get it's not indicative of being a good coach, but how can you not see how that's relevant lol   he looked out of the circle but was clearly moving   sounds like Nurse sending siakam a message lol   give seth an assist on that. just him standing on the 3 pt line got embiid a 1v1 bbq chicken opportunity   Shoot a crumbled paper 3 into a trash can as celebration   When did Ainge not make a trade for a star when it would have only cost middling to late draft picks?   You had them the next year. That was your chance to prove that theory correct.

Reality is sometimes disappointing   Well Tatum‚Äôs been the first option on pretty much all of those teams that got further then Simmons did. On teams that, in your words, were worse than the Sixers team that didn‚Äôt even make the ECF. 

So tell me how that works out to Simmons being better in the playoffs than Tatum?   130   Yep, as long as they call them players are going to do it. You'd be putting yourself at a disadvantage if you didn't. Jeremy Lin is a good case of this, he would rarely overexaggerate or sell the contact, and it was a big factor into why he got so few calls. 

What needs to happen is the league needs to actually address this instad of just occasionally handing out a fine whenever they feel like it to give off the illusion of attempting to improve the system.   I understand you and your views. You assumed his views weren‚Äôt consistent by saying what about Steph. You didn‚Äôt refute his point. You asked if he was a hypocrite.   since he got to the magic he‚Äôs been good   [removed]   Stacey, did you not get the memo?!   Hes either getting punished for walking off the court early last game.

or Harden incoming   Benched. Jk who knows   Siakam (embarrassed) is out tonight.   This is why social science is important   Lol 4 games doesn‚Äôt wash out the other 105 games he‚Äôs played   Be dangerous   This is a pretty big deal right? Siakam isn‚Äôt injured so either he‚Äôs being benched for poor play, or he‚Äôs getting traded. Probably just a benching, but you never know   o-5 back on the menu babyyyy   [deleted]   They both greatly benefitted.   Is it normal for one company to shit all over a rival in an ad like Xfiniti just did to AT&amp;T? Dissin better than rappers these days   lmao I haven't thought about that guy for at least a decade but now it's all I'll see when I watch lowry   You heard him boys   You aint getting Harden for Pascal Siakam lmfao   LeBron honestly needs to be clowned until he apologizes to Morey. He was completely wrong, and his statement calls his very integrity into question.   We can miss Ricky together :(   [deleted]   [deleted]   [deleted]   &gt;A 3 point shot would catapult him above Tatum easily 

&gt;I'm very much a Celtics homer but come on, Tatum &gt; Ben easily

These two things are not mutually exclusive   Thanks for including the whole transcript   We can‚Äôt all just get bailed out because Lebron knows he can make your front office his bitch.   God I love our young guys   he‚Äôs been good since he got to the magic?   I honestly don't think so. Simmons has amazing defense compared to murray, who has mediocre at best defense. For a team with a strong defensive presence like the sixers, thats crucial. Murray also doesn't score at a particularly higher rate than simmons, and isn't as good a playmaker. While his spacing would be useful, I think the sixers should run it back. They have a better team than last year, and while it may not be quite as good as the 2019 team, that team barely lost to the eventual champs, which is pretty good.   Depends on your definition of good. Id say he's been serviceable and popular and slightly exciting at times. But mostly just popular   100%. Just reading this post's title I thought, ""Is it the Chris Paul move?""   John Stockton didn‚Äôt even start until he was 25   did the guy just say that john wall went to georgetown during the intros?   ... what about Luka?   League fucked   We should‚Äôve stopped the count after game 4.   Jokic lite, I'm a fan.   &gt; He‚Äôs third in the league in drives per game after harden and LeBron.

Citation ? Just because you are accusing me of lying, i'm pretty sure thats projection for making shit up yourself. 

&gt; Some facts this year:

&gt; He‚Äôs shooting the lowest % at the rim in his career (OKC included)

Dude why are you just proving my point over and over? 

&gt; He‚Äôs shooting more midrange jumpers than ever

That's why *I* fucking said.

His game was never to take guys off the dribble to the rim, as i've said over and over. He might cross a dude up but he'll still drop a mid range 90% of the time. Why can you admit this very simple fact?   Poor baby   He can shoot 3s now? Harden for Simmons straight swap, done deal   can the lakers afford him   He's active.   Such bad news to wake up the new year with.   The Wizards dance crew don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre having fun at all   Honestly, when I heard him talk, I was surprised how British it sounded. Much different than Straya. 

New Zealand might be my dream place to move. People seem pretty chill and it looks like you can grow some awesome gardens. I would love to have a little land with fruit trees.   Yea, he‚Äôs been solid thus far. 76ers may just be his boogeyman   Where is the foul   He wasn‚Äôt attributing it to Kyle‚Äôs ass literally, he‚Äôs just calling him a fatass   I was afraid the success would get to his head   [removed]   I don't pretend to know Rudy's intention, but this argument is often used to downplay the importance of these milestones.

Like yeah, it will be nice when this is such a common thing that no one cares or notices. She is literally the first ever, though, so it is progress worth celebrating.   He‚Äôs a god damn monster   You mean kill me with guns or knives?   Comes with being a contender, it‚Äôll somewhat subside when the Clippers get it rolling.   I agree that Powell works best with the starters, but why not just adjust the lineups throughout the game? Why bench Siakam for this? 

I don't wanna think Masai would make a trade this early into the season but hey, who knows   He's got the shakes that'll make you quake   Nuggets about to offer Jamison Crowder and Ronald Jones for Harden.   Aren't the Nuggets 1-3 right now? Jokic might very well win the MVP, but I think the question is whether the Nuggets will have a high enough seed. They have some issues to work out. You're assuming they'll have a high seed, but you make no case for it.   for sure. they both changed how offense is played now. It's a 3 point crazy league because Steph forced it to be. 

Flopping is now an actual basketball skill that gets rewarded because Harden made it mainstream.   The College Football Playoff committee hates underdog stories   A real one, Stacey King   I've said this in other threads but I honestly don't think the idea of shooting even crosses his mind most of the time. When he actually shoots you can see there really isn't any hesitation. His weird drive and 180 thing looks planned too.   He could save others from trading away their young core but not himself   [deleted]   Finally, we get the Wall vs Fox matchup   popular?   [deleted]   I love em but blue is weird as fuck on the Rockets   Sounds like y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like the teams you just hate the heat.   League fucked   CP3 and Cam Payne makes me not miss Ricky though. He was a great person to have on the team and really helped develop our current culture, but this team is something fierce right now. May the best team win.   Anyone else miss EG lol   I feel like that‚Äôs okay for a role player but star players should boost their production in the playoffs.   He stopped shooting jumpers entirely. It wasnt always this extreme. He used to take [occassional 15 footers](https://go.nba.com/rfgn) he took 43 as a rookie and only 5 shots from 15-19 ft all of last year. 

All three of his 3's he's made in his career have been plays specifically called for him to shoot where there's pressure on him to not pass up the shot. Just something happened since even when he entered the league where anything outside of 10 feet he just is not comfortable at all ever taking anymore.   Lol at rebuilt. More like draft mediocre talent, atract lebron because your in la, and get a bunch of free agents while forcing the pelicans to do what you want. Wouldn‚Äôt call that a rebuild   To go along with the chess analogies, Hikaru Nakamura, considered the best blitz chess player in history, responded to an article called ""The Real Reason all the Top Chess Players are Men"" in a youtube video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ZdlbKVU7Y). The article talks about the statistical advantage a larger population has over a smaller one in competitive fields, even excluding any intrinsic differences between the two sub-pupulations. He talks about the large difference in cultural and social stigma that leads to the chess world consisting of 90+% being men. That leads to the field being a majority male-dominant at the top and allows people to make outrageous claims that men are intrinsically more intellectual and strategic-minded than women, when it is in-fact more a statistical expectation due to the population difference.

Obviously the difference between men's and women's sports lie primarily within genetics, but when it comes to things such as strategy and intellect, it is more often a societal bias or stigma causing inequity, not an intrinsic difference between the populations. There are some damn good female coaches out there who are willing and do put in as much work as many of their peers, and are probably on an equal or better intellectual level than their male counterparts. Unfortunately there is still a cultural stigma around female coaches which lead to other problems such as lack of respect or physical intimidation.   Are you a real Mavs fan? Obviously no one was saying the rest of his roster was ass cheeks but he was the only special talent on his team other Kidd who was in his twilight years regardless. Everyone else was just above average role players. 

And yeah, Wade played a lot better than LeBron in that series despite being not as good as LeBron.   It really is, tripping me out   Really could‚Äôve turned out like Mose for a moment there   I'm glad 2011 happened both to Dirk and to LeBron. The way that finals series impacted both these guys in ways that are completely different is one of the beautiful aspects of this game. I'm glad Dirk completed his redemption arc and brought a ring to Dallas by beating LeBron and Wade the way he did. If there was a god of basketball, that was the most fair outcome.

I'm also glad LeBron lost those series the way he lost, without of which we wouldn't have current LeBron. I'm not going so far as to say this humbled him completely, but definitely adjusted his mentality and approach. That loss was important in that LeBron realized basketball would always be bigger than him and if he was going to leave a legacy, he'd have to start showing respect, not only to himself, but to the other greats as well.   did you read the post?   Wizards can‚Äôt be this bad   Bruh yes its fucking stupid and needs to be called out but Kyrie in PARTICULAR is not the devil, thats my only point.

I'm a COVID research scientist lmao, I get why it fucking sucks because I'm the one that has to deal with it all the time.

So yeah defo call Kyrie out - nothing wrong with that. He dumb for that and needs to get shit for that. 

But THAT aspect of himself, in terms of not only realworld impact, but also in terms of how much it negatively defines him, is FAR outweighed by the good the dude does. So yeah call him out, but nephews talk about him like he's the fucking anti-science devil who wants to take us all back to the stone age. And he ain't. 

He's a good dude who sometimes says stupid shit and he believes his stupid shit way more than he should alotta the time. And so call him out on the latter. But he's a good dude. That's all I'm tryna say   I for one would never buy insurance sold by  Vernon Schillinger"
nfl,2021,"  The best looking coach is a tie between Andy Reid and Bruce Arians.   Oh my God, no...

This is literally season altering.   Oh Shit   Mason Rudolph like ""it's over Browns, I have the high ground""   if the 1 seed doesn't get a bye you might honestly see teams resting for 2 or 3 weeks instead of just 1.   Honestly forgot Josh Allen went to Wyoming. He was such a great story, I agree he‚Äôs more of a super rare development than common place. Every draft there is G5 and D2 QBs taken and they almost always bust. Wentz was the best D2 QB prospect EVER and he still sucked after his MVP level year that looks more and more like an outlier. Lance is an athletic guy with a great arm but a bad mechanic and an even worse mind for making reads. Wilson is super athletic at BYU but no telling how it‚Äôll translate to the NFL. I think they‚Äôll both bust but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Fields may or may not be good, depends more on his attitude and work ethic which I know nothing about. Lawrence is the only safe pick this year. QB class is really just Lawrence and scraps this year, not sure why everyone is so high on them   Yeah, but that's still a dick move. If the question is ""tell us about a time you lost"" your answer can't be ""there was this time I won a race. I'm telling you about it so that the other 31 losers don't have to""; it's an arrogant answer.

If someone asks about draft whiffs for my team I'm not going to talk about how good Marlon Humphrey is and how people before us wish they had him, I'm going to talk about how much we would 100% take back Hollywood Brown.   Negligence *is* a factor. Keyword factor. But it's not the only way to get COVID. And the maniac scenario isn't the only other way. Having kids that go to school or daycare for example, or a spouse that has a job they have to go to, etc.   Damn. That fucking sucks.   Chicken curry with vegetables and rice.   DK and Justin Jefferson in consecutive years fuck me   What the fuck that‚Äôs horrible   Fuck injuries   Fucking brutal man   &gt; My best days are ahead

Well they'd almost have to be, wouldn't they?   Here's what I said

&gt;I almost guarantee we will go with split carries between Dillon and Williams next year. Rodgers has been praising Williams all year and he's proven he can do it. Dillon appears to be showing he can also do it.

See how you made things up about me saying Dillon is proven?

This is why this debate is pointless. You fail to properly read my points, then put words in my mouth.   [deleted]   [deleted]   God damn that‚Äôs a huge loss. Best wishes on his road to recovery but that definitely sucks.   Yup last day of 2020 right there. Fuck this year absolutely horrible   I think you mean palate unless you have a big wooden thing you put pickles and wine on   [deleted]   No :(   Oh no :/ that‚Äôs a huge loss. Heal up Bakhtiari   ‚Äú36-31= 5 verticals. You get that Brady?‚Äù - Bruce Arians   Ah okay. Didn't realize it was a joke. I see this take constantly like Ohio State is the only blue blood or major school who's never had a good QB or not had one remotely recently   WOW that's a huge loss.   Try again Mr.Leaf. Bears are going to beat Green Bay this week and then going to beat them again in Lambeau next week.   Fuck 2020   Oooff. Now that is a game changer. Wow.   Fuck 2020   Best pass protector in football.  Hope he doesn‚Äôt lose his lateral quickness, because of this.   What the fuck   I'm saying it's hilarious you think no one but Donald when Mack won one with one of the worst resumes for a DPOY in decades back in 2017.   FUCK FUCK FUCK   What a shit end to a shit year   That's a huge blow. Hate to see it.   ‚ÄúThe standard is the standard‚Äù   All those players that outed themselves as anti-Semites then hardly anyone said anything about it.   i can hear it now...   suckramento kangz gang!   Mitch and that bot need to get a room already   [deleted]   [deleted]   Dak had Mike fucking McCarthy at head coach and he still didn't have a bad game.   This is actually *really fucking bad* for the Packers chances in the playoffs

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre toast, but it‚Äôs hard to replicate an all-pro LT that just signed a 100m+ contract   I‚Äôm gonna dolphin dive off my roof fucking hell   [deleted]   well that's just about the worst thing that could have happened to them short of the same news about Rodgers. 

It happening this late means the first month or two of 2021 are now in question. terrible.   [deleted]   Wings and my dip   \*Sad Buffalo noises* :(   2020 with the buzzer beater   We have lads already in 2021 üò°

u/MushroomMan89 escaped 2020 without us all....how selfish   Oh my god   1 pass   [deleted]   Um, what the fuck.

Line actually played well when he was out this year. But this just sucks.   Huge F.  Packers' playoff dreams...   I endorse this tweet!

Next, I hope Anthony Lynn is extended in LA.   I think the off-season workouts with Palmer have made a huge difference, but the in-season work he puts in does as well.   Tbh as a neutral observer pulling for you guys the holds seemed pretty obvious. Now I only watched the end of the game, so maybe those calls were being ignored earlier, but they seemed like holds to me.   2020 just wouldn't go out quietly. 

Fuck this year   [deleted]   I am prepared to make all the ""Its been a whole year since I last saw you"" jokes to each and every person I know until everyone teams up and Julius Caesar's me   Ask her to play it with you and/or teach her how to play it   [deleted]   where da booze at   Work is done so I‚Äôm now officially on vacation until January 11!   https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/knv09n/highlight_aj_dillon_runs_over_300_pound_de_matt/ghnfd6x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3.  Don‚Äôt even remember what you typed. SMH. Be done.   How about yes?   Time for Elgton Jenkins to start stone walling mother fuckers. Full steam ahead at this point. Just gotta keep going at this point with the playoffs ahead.   Fuuuuuuck   [deleted]   Second  worst possible injury that could have happened for the Packers. This is fucking awful.   [deleted]   Awful. Injuries are going to happen but it always feels worse going into playoffs when youre hoping to see everyone‚Äôs best football. Also puts any offseason work in jeopardy   This late in the year, it's going to linger into next year, too, in terms of affecting his play.

Fuck.   Pretty much our only real improvement would be Eifert and I guess Norwell would be a beast like he was with the Panthers instead of slightly above average that he is now. Young team problems.   Everytime I see a fumble in a game I start yelling FUMBLEROOSKI like Ed O'Neill thanks to this movie.   I read something by a doctor back in 2012. I don't have the article or link anymore but what he was saying is that if anything, teams need a ton more practice, but stage it by intensity. Like start in May, but nothing over 50%. That time would be spent getting guys back into shape, getting rookies up to speed, assessing injury recovery, walkthroughs of the playbook, etc. June, you can ramp things up a bit. Get pads on a few times a week, up the intensity, etc. Rest guys if you need. Then come training camp in July, you go full intensity like any other year.  
  
The doctor felt this would prevent both catastrophic injuries and nagging, chronic injuries as players wouldn't be thrown right into the fire immediately.   I wanted the Ravens to draft Stefon Diggs so badly. He went to Maryland too.   Not even a Night Lads...   During practice?! Damn. That sucks   [deleted]   2020 FUCK YOU   I was really hyped for us to get Mahomes because it was the first time we‚Äôd heard genuine interest in replacing Brees. When we missed out I wasn‚Äôt really that devastated but looking back I‚Äôm so pissed.   Come the fuck on   Did the fire department actually show up at your place? lol what an asshole   [deleted]   RIP DOOM   Fuck 2020. Fuck it all   I‚Äôm really bad with homophones.   Man, practice injuries suck even more than in game ones imo. The one Deshauns rookie year was just terrible.   I'll start that at around 9, if I start earlier than that I'll be asleep before midnight haha   honestly reading this i kinda wish the buccs didnt have brady. Staff to Evans would be a match made in heaven   still got 6 hours by my watch. plenty of time for shit to get worse   [deleted]   and in that bye week the 31st and 32nd ranked teams play each other to determine the #1 overall pick. Put this ""tanking"" nonsense to bed once and for all.   [deleted]   Holy shit.   That's all a great story, but Cowboys fans still wanted him pretty bad. The Packers shouldn't have ever had the chance to pick him.   Oh my god   [My JUDGEMENT](https://i.imgur.com/GcXZkp0.jpg)   The second worst person they could lose man this sucks.  I hope he recovers well would be ashame for him to lose his lateral quickness.   This is why I'm hesitant about LaFleur. We have to see how he builds his own roster. Tomlin did well in that department from 2014 onward after most of Cowher's guys had moved on, but he hasn't had to hunt for a new QB yet.   They're also paying the price for kicking the can down the road this year and probably next year.   [removed]   QB Rushing Attempts:

Murray - 131 
Lamar - 148   [deleted]   You son of a bitch.   wow thats terrible   I don‚Äôt get angry irl a whole lot anymore but sometimes I still flashback to situations and get irrationally angry in my head for like 10 sec till it passes.

I don‚Äôt think anger is bad, but it‚Äôs still something that has to be controlled.

That said I still am an extremely petty person.   You mean sad packer noises. Although I'm not actually sure what a Packer is now that I think about it   I felt this bruh.   ""I can see clearly now, the Gase is gone!""   spending my NYE making my annual playlist. ALT 2021, your time is soon.   38-14   Jesus that is fucking brutal   I think any time they start calling someone ""the next....."" whatever ..it most times doesn't work out. But maybe I am just a pessimist   [deleted]   I will? They're both incredible QBs but so far Mahomes is on a different level because he performs during prime time   I was gonna root for the Cards and I still am, but it's hard not to root for a guy like this.   Even though Washington is one of my rivals in the NFC East and their loss is the key for the Giants to possibly make it to the playoffs, I rather get in when all the teams are at their best, including coaches. I know cancer fucking sucks like crazy and hope RR will persevere through it. Much respect to the dude.   Facts same here   ACAB 

A LL 

C OPS 

A RE 

B AD DRIVERS   Yeah, How could prime Fournette ever be stopped.   I'm honestly surprised Elway didn't draft Josh Allen when he had the chance   That is horrifically shitty.   ""I'm not sure that's in my wheelhouse though""= I really don't want to do this shoot unless you're planning on paying, please take the hint   wym

the earth revolves around America   MVP curse kicking in real quick.   Congrats, you got into an NFL ad.   Not sure it that's the best way to figure it out. Sometimes I post threads, toggle replies off, and forget to check back on the thread for days.   Drew Lock is Jameis 2.0. A good ‚ÄòQB‚Äô with horrible tendencies.   The downside of starting a new job in September, almost no fucking vacation time accrued.   Dallas won because Jerry insisted they go all out going for superstars.

It typically doesn‚Äôt work out and is a bad move, but it worked for a hot second and they won some rings because of it. They‚Äôve been doing it ever since and it hasn‚Äôt worked again.   Can Snacks play offensive tackle?   In the last minutes 2020 fucks the Packers.   Wow, I dislike this guy cuz of the rivalry of course but damn I do not want to see this at all   Oh my God what the fuck   Dude that is some absolute shit, I'm sorry.

If it's any consolation, nobody who does that was worth getting to know more, anyway. It's a cheap price to pay to find out they were human garbage.   Oh sure they are. They may not have the worst record, but they *are* the worst team.   My parents are the ones who got me into it!   Wooow that is huge, absolutely brutal for him and the Packers   [deleted]   yeah, that‚Äôs definitely a big part of how I work on it, breaking it down into little bits to explore, think about, and try to learn on. Eventually, it got a little easier to replace that anger with something neutral or even positive and the progress really feels good, even if it‚Äôs something small   I'm expecting Ryan or Stafford to end up in DEN   ugh fuck me   When the niners took Alex Smith I was hoping they would go with the local (Cal ) guy, Aaron Rodgers instead.  He‚Äôs had a nice career...   Wow   FUCK   Seriously what the fuck

What the fuck...   Pizza rolls and cheese dip   Bakhtiari is a former CU Buff. Seemed kinda inappropriate to post a ""Sko Buffs"" here tho   and the receiver talent is not much different hahah, I agree, but who knows really. I would hope it'd work out, and I wish we were finding out. Stinkin ravens   [deleted]   god damnit   Absolutely wild they kept it under wraps for two whole months   Crunchy or puffed? Puffed. Haha wuss. 

I say that line anytime I see something eating cheeto puffs.   Well with Corona, Trevor is a lucky man.   Magic Johnson - ‚ÄúLosing such an important player will hurt the Packers‚Äô chances in the playoffs, and could even prevent them winning the Super Bowl.‚Äù   Wow   A worker in a cheese factory.   [deleted]   Jay Cutler might be funny, but I feel like he would suffer from a crippling lack of likability, he always seemed like such an asshole on the field.   Okay buddy - pull a comment from a different reply that is different contextually (similar, but different).

You've strayed so far from the original point you were trying to argue because every time I brought it back you changed it again. 

You put words in my mouth multiple times that I didn't say. You pulled other comments that weren't from our conversation trying to use them when they were not arguing the same point. Just fucking be okay that we can disagree and that some fans are okay with not throwing millions at Jones next year.   Pretty much yes. But Wilson has been trending everywhere so not surprised.   Holy shit lmao.   You don't see anyway for him to be on the field with 3 other d-lineman and he's rushing outside?   Ravens vs Packers SB, battle of injured Left Tackles!!!   [deleted]   That‚Äôs a shame   [deleted]   [deleted]   Lmao   At this time last year, I was getting high in my friend's house and his parents were around.

They somehow knew he was high, but not me.   &gt;  It forces them to address their actual needs instead of pretending like Lawrence can fix everything  
    
This is such a lazy take because that was never the plan. We have the second-most cap space and 4 additional top-100 picks to build around Wilson or Fields (plus a new coaching staff!). We were never going to just draft Trevor and sit there with a thumb up our ass for the rest of the offseason expecting him to fix everything.  
   
Darnold is still the weakest link on the offense, people that believe otherwise haven't watched the Jets all year (and I don't blame them). His footwork is horrific, he can't read a defense pre-snap and stays on his first read way too long, isn't decisive with the football, and has accuracy and turnover problems. The Jets would be moronic to keep him around next year   They're ahead of you elsewhere   So nice!   jesus christ that‚Äôs a massive loss   good beer   Damn that sucks. After watching the Vikings OL for years a player of Bakhs caliber is greatly appreciated. Seems like a cool guy too. Rodgers is gonna miss him, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be back to his All Pro form next year.   Damn that sounds good   Missing our best starters   Goddamn it all to hell   a true booze lord!   If Julio or Matty leave before they retire they're definitely on the list.   It‚Äôs somone who boxes up things to be taken to shops.   This is gonna be strange but animals/pets are my main reason of hope for humanity.

If dogs, cats, humans can all get along like that and we don‚Äôt rip each others heads off I think it shows us how we could be.   Yeah thats probably more accurate!   As stacked as they might have been, the data doesn't show they performed as a top 5 defense that year. But it's your opinion, so it doesn't matter   Thanks 2020 you bitch   Fuck 2020, this sucks so bad!   The Tight End difference is staggering though. Jackson's MVP campaign largely came from his connections to Andrews. The Patriots don't have any tight ends at all.   Yeah. Soley because of baker and not because they drafted 1st two years in a row. Remind me, how many first round picks did they have those two years?   JJ wouldn't replace Dupree.  He would replace Tuitt or Heyward, which is why it isn't happening.   I haven't had that happen to me as bad. But I've been on the receiving end of quite a few ghosts. It sucks and it hurts. But It's on them as shitty people, not you. Don't doubt yourself.   Y'all ever play dem Mario and Luigi games? Well lemme tell ya in one of em Mario up and chugs water from a geyser or a broken pipe until he becomes fat and round and just filled to the brim with water and Luigi goes and hits him with his hammer and Mario spits all the water out and he's back to normal. Anyway I want Darren Waller to fill me to Water Mario levels.   You compared them to Chunt.  The same with me.  LOL. Keep your backtracking.  And the. Said they have proven themselves.  Moon walk your ass out of this like you said you were done.   Actually has been talk that Jets only like Trevor and that they would focus on the line with Becton already in place to help Darnold. I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely with a new coach.   Wow, that‚Äôs fucking brutal.   &gt; I just think Gronk was a complete game-changer in a way that no TE had ever been prior to him 

People forget about Kellen Winslow   I wasn't saying that they shouldn't tank, or shouldn't start a shitty quarterback. I'm saying that without a lottery, it's stupid for them not to.   Deion and play him.  Immediately our best corner   Ahhh man u. Practice, and this late in the season   Surprised he isn‚Äôt first given how highly PFF weights pass protection over run blocking.

This post was removed by a human moderator; this comment was left by a bot.   He is physically capable of doing it but he's not physically capable of being very good at it.

Hell, I'm physically capable of doing it and I'm 145 pounds. I'd get my shit kicked in immediately though.   Game respects game   i think there's still some possibility for shifting in seeding, but we have won the division no matter what   So genuine question then. Why the fuck are you posting a question like this and then never checking it for days? Is it for karma farming? What other reason is there to post a question you obviously don't care about.   It‚Äôs a loss but aren‚Äôt the Packers stacked with OL? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this doesn‚Äôt hurt them that much.   [deleted]   [deleted]   Are you fucking kidding me...   [deleted]   A lot of draft analysts had Harry as the best WR coming out of that draft class, and even if the team had drafted Deebo or AJ Brown, or Metcalf for that matter, there's absolutely no guarantee they would be performing at the same level in New England.

It's also disingenuous as hell to point towards the lack of quality LBs while using Jamie Collins, Kyle Van Noy and Dont'a Hightower as examples. Collins and Van Noy left in free agency and the team had absolutely no cap space to sign anyone else, and Hightower opted out. The opt-outs came months after the start of agency, and before them there was a point where New England had less than half a million in cap space.

This article seems to think building an NFL roster is something that happens in a vacuum.   [deleted]   This is why I recommend getting herd immunity early on


Edit: /s lol   It‚Äôs gonna be billy turner if Rick Wagner is healthy, I‚Äôd guess.   I was hoping everyone would be so stupid as to let the Pats get Herbert   !emojify   Your link is a 403 error.   Why did the thread of Bakhtiari saying the Packers ‚Äòwanted to beat the piss out of the Bears‚Äô get deleted?

I had to read that title multiple times today but the moment the thread actually becomes interesting it gets deleted   Hello friends   Theyd be dumb to give him a long term extension but they'd have to at least extend him another year or two.   oh, ab-so-lutely. Was going to mention it, but it's so glaring I figured I didn't need to. Just wanted to enjoy not being the only team that can't find receivers for a fleeting moment.   Even when they don't ghost they make up some bullshit about ""not being ready for a relationship"" despite being on the fucking apps in the first place.  

They're all fucking cowards.   If Derwin did not fall to 17 a good number of us wanted Lamar Jackson.

A lot of us wanted Malik Hooker instead of Mike Williams, not sure which was better. Probably still Mike because he has had 2 good seasons. There was  also a group who wanted CMC, but that was a minority.   LMMFAO at everyone saying Bucs.


It's either gonna be the Steelers, Bears, 49ers, Cowboys, Ravens or Packers   We‚Äôre literally gonna have an 11-5 team miss the playoffs for the third time ever.   Haskins, Smith, who‚Äôs the third?   I'm just glad we have depth. Slide ElgTron to LT   Please do it again   last minute decided to do a pot roast for new year's. some potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, red wine, beef broth, thyme/rosemary/bay leaf, seared the thing and now cooking it low for maybe like 4 hours. it'll be a late dinner but i'm hoping it turns out ok   As a Knicks fan, fuck the lottery. Worst team deserves the best pick. Period.   Will do! Enjoy your reddit battle win buddy! You continue to walk around the main argument then tried to be a badass by speaking in extremes. Sad. 

I'll say it - you win. Congrats. Enjoy it!   Remember, the NFL isn't making covid decisions based on competitive advantages or disadvantages (or so they say anyway). They don't care if it fucks over the steelers. And do we actually know the outbreak was from people on the Browns being irresponsible? I hadn't heard that yet   Bro you gotta lay down the law. You can't count on people taking hints.   Meeting up with a girl for New Years and then probably coming home to ring it in with a bottle of champagne (unless I get really lucky.) All after fucking around at work and getting to leave early.

It's going to be a nice way to kiss this year goodbye any way it shakes out.   Yeah, [here's](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/02/peytons-perfect-memory-brings-tennessee-play-to-denver/) a story about how he asked Tennessee to send him film of a specific play he had done with them 16 years prior.   plz no. We finally got a franchise quarterback, don't break him.   It would be so hilarious to see Baltimore miss the playoffs because they lost to the bengals. Imagine Losing to bengals and messing up your seeding   Holy fucking shit   He's a stupid ass mother fucking traitor turtle.   My dipshit friend doesn‚Äôt get it, mind explaining it to him?   Same. I was looking forward to this game and honestly, kinda hope we sit our starters now because of this. Especially it Tua can‚Äôt go due to close contact.   Yeah but damn cheaters had him and 12 others on the field at a time.   [deleted]   Been so long since I‚Äôve played drinking games. I know we‚Äôre not back to normal yet but tonight is nice to have after this year   The one game Bakhtiari was out this year Rodgers got eaten alive by the Bucs. Kill me now   I‚Äôm dead inside   What does the D stand for?   ‚ÄúWe made it out of 2020!‚Äù - Some random Packers fan

‚ÄúAnd I took that personally.‚Äù - 2020   I hate English lol   2020 getting in one last ‚ÄòFuck You‚Äô   Ah ok. Should have been obvious to me but I had never thought about it until just today for whatever reason.   Where can I buy plants for cheap? Some that are good for indoor use? 
 
 
I wanna rearrange my room and put some plants on a shelf near the window.   FMl   [deleted]   I wouldn't be shocked if neither of those teams make it, in fact I don't think I'd even say Green Bay is the favorite to come out of the NFC. Crowning them now is ridiculous.   so if you win a race you can't talk about the race or other placements in the race? thats makes 0 sense, and my comment was very on topic because those 2 specific player *have* been brought up a lot in that exact same context. do people really get upset if a guy is like ""yeah, people usually feel this way about 2 players my team drafted""? really?   It sucks for sure, but our entire line has been playing lights out this year. Bakh will be missed, but I still like our chances.   Silver lining is that Elton Jenkins is amazing wherever he's filled in. 

Tall order though going against Mack immediately.   This is all of major American media programs. Ever try to watch any prime time game show or ‚Äútalent‚Äù show. 3/4s of the show is how the persons dog died when they were 5 or some shit. It‚Äôs awful and I genuinely don‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs personal tragedy. Its just lazy producing and pisses me off. Like we all have some tragedy it doesn‚Äôt define us.   It's probably in their best interests that Hurts looks good.   If it makes you feel better the Ravens took 2 WRs in that class during the first three rounds and while neither of them are as bad as JJaw they are both definitely busts.   Ok Mary Kay, you had a dumb question, just get over it.   Did he really beat him?   Y'all üî•ü§ï ever play üíãüéÆ dem Mario üë∫üë∫ and Luigi games? üéÆüéÆ Well üê≥ lemme üèø tell üó£ ya in one üíã of üçí em Mario üë∫üë∫ up üòçüò© and chugs water üÖ±üëå from a geyser or üÖ±üèõ a üòÇüëå broken üçÜ pipe üåùüåö until üò©üçÜ he becomes üìâ fat üêÑ and round and üëè just üëèüòÇ filled üîã to ‚úÇüí¶ the brim with üëâ water and üëèüîô Luigi goes üôäüöã and hits üí• him with his hammer üî®üî® and üï∞üëä Mario spits all üïù the water üí¶ out üò≥‚û° and üëè he's back to üí¶üÖ± normal. Anyway üîõüîõ I üíñ want üëè Darren üíØ Waller to fill me üë§üíñ to üí¶ Water üçÜ Mario levels. üìä   You mean when we trade down? Again?   NO GOD PLEASE NO   Obviously it's a big blow, but may not be as bad as it seems. Elgton Jenkins can slide over and do that job well. The interior will suffer a little, but it's still a stronger unit than most playoff teams have.   Kyle Allen   Yeah, that would suck.   Wait wtf I missed that detail   The visual you paint of John Elway getting his rocks off by playing with a behemoth and a lil guy made me snort laugh..(please win sunday).   Seconded.   JIM NANCE!   Agreed (and not just because I‚Äôm a fan of the 8th place team)   At least he got his bag! Sucks it happened at all though   Happy New Year Lads!   That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call, catastrophic.   LOL ok.  Mr I can‚Äôt follow directions.   Terrible. 

Definitely a huge impact on Rodgers success and Packers O in general. 

And the world lost DOOM today 

I‚Äôm turning off social media rest of day, next I‚Äôll find out that Santa was a child abuser. 

See you in 2021   That's only the second message from me in the exchange, after this I definitely will be if he doesn't figure it out   8 hours here you lucky bastards   Well fuck.   [deleted]   [removed]   [deleted]   Or just do a draft lottery   You have got to be kidding me.   Andre, you stole that from Ochocinco.   I feel that. I wish someone would just say ""look I'm just not into you"" when they try to let me down. At least that would be honest and upfront about it.   I‚Äôd hope he would if that were the case. Douglas just hasn‚Äôt earned the benefit of the doubt to be forgiven if he wastes more time on Darnold than he has to   He's excellent. You've probably heard him before without knowing it, he was the rapper on November has Come by Gorillaz.   [deleted]   oh, without a doubt, but I don't think darnold is a lost cause, allen is in a much better situation there is no denying that. I'm not saying darnold will become better than allen he might he might not idk nfl is random but I don't think he's a lost cause.  


edit: I said I don't think he's a lost cause twice hahah fuck also smart money is obv on him NOT being better than allen.   Fucking over playoff teams is literally all we have now.   Lol   Fuck   What? I intend to go back but I may just forget. I posted the other day asking if Sean Payton had a shot at making the Hall of Fame, and forgot to go back and see what people said until like 12 hours later.

 
Obviously not care about? It's just forgetting mixed with it not being a question I need answered immediately.   Man just when it seems likes it‚Äôs our year   [deleted]   You should tag the plant gang.... Though the only one I remember for sure is vissass. She never turns down a gang.   That was kinda my point.  He's been great, but there were so many other better options.   People theorize that Luck stayed for his senior year of college cuz he didn't want to get drafted by Carolina, but that's not the same thing obv   I wouldn't mind that tbh. Would be fun.   People are feeling European I guess   You have got to be kidding me...   Damn   I'm bringing you with me just give me 5-10 hours"
politics,2021,"  Is it legal for them to have Venmo and PayPal for donations?   [deleted]   They are expensive because a significant amount are never paid.   Just gonna leave out the part where Trump is doing this too   [deleted]   Congress would still likely have to certify it, just like they have to certify the results of the electoral college. This headline would likely be the same even if we'd gotten rid of the EC.   [deleted]   I really don‚Äôt get why? Mitch has more power than the president. He can disagree and blocked what ever he chooses even if it‚Äôs for the greater good for all Americans. He came keep his job longer than anyone else and finally earn 14k a month while laughing in the face of hurting Americans. 6 more years is way to much, then another 6 and another 6, Mitch is the 666.   We‚Äôve been there for decades (see McCarthyism) but now we‚Äôve perfected it.   No he hasn‚Äôt told 20k lies and the article plainly states that it also counts misleading information as well and There‚Äôs a difference. You saying that this Trump has lied 20k times is a lie. Trump giving his opinion that Obama did or didn‚Äôt want to do something is not a lie at worst it‚Äôs misleading but nobody know what Obama wanted or didn‚Äôt want to do. If Trump is a con-man and he‚Äôs been doing it his whole life and that‚Äôs the only reason he is where he is today do you really think that he would be such a bad one? Every politician is a con-Man/Woman

What other person? Again I‚Äôm confused by your logic if Trump is a con man would he not want to do what people wanted him to do? Would he not do everything in his power to save face in the public eye to win re-election? So England is the roughly the same position as us (actually worse) but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Trump might be average it‚Äôs just because everyone else is also terrible? 

Yep you‚Äôve got me I can‚Äôt explain away that the US is 4% of the population to be exact 4.25% why would I try to explain that away?

Well you are wrong about this one there are possible reasons that it could be explained. 1( I know people who have been tested once and got sent two positive test results. And 2( remember all those developing countries? How many of them are able to get the same amount of testing that we have in America? 

I agree but that‚Äôs not Trumps fault. If a sports team is doing bad is the blame solely on the manager? No it‚Äôs usually on the entire team. I know that Trump handled it poorly but I also think that most other countries handled it poorly and it‚Äôs stupid to act like Trump is the only reason that a GLOBAL PANDEMIC is killing people

Agreed nothing Biden has done makes anything that Trump has done Right or Wrong but I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt think Biden would have handled it better although even if he did handle it worse everyone would still be worshiping him because it‚Äôs just a trend now to hate Trump 

If you want to say that Trump will go down in history as the president with the worst response to a Global pandemic than that‚Äôs your opinion I guess even if there is probably plenty of worse options but that‚Äôs not what you said you said he was the worst President in US history and that‚Äôs just not true   [removed]   [removed]   I‚Äôd argue the people have provided enough military aid   I hope no counter protesters show up..   I want them to get so mad that they just start shooting each other...   Isn't it a little suspicious that it's always Republicans. Hurr, durr.

1 man 1 turtle enter

1 man leaves with an excess of turtle soup   [deleted]   I accidentally stumbled upon it last night when someone posted a meme about trump looking more bad ass than his security üòÇ I laughed out loud while reading the comments. Donald trump looking ‚Äúbad ass‚Äù ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   Over 40% of adult Kentuckians didn't vote.   [deleted]   [deleted]   At Trump making a habit of selectively declassifying tiny bits of cherry picked information while lying about the overwhelming majority that leads all credible current and former intel officials to a completely different conclusion.

There's been plenty.  Like dozens of intel officials making public statements for the first time in their lives to stop him plenty.

In fact, he's such a bumbling cartoon criminal that he's repeatedly implicated himself or his administration by mistake by sharing cherry picked intel he failed to comprehend or by simply sharing Russian disinformation directly that STILL HAS THE  RUSSIAN STATE TV WATERMARK ON IT.

But yes.  Some people are stupid enough to take the table scraps he throws out while ignoring that every current and former intelligence officer who's not an appointed stooge all say the exact same thing which he simply ignores.

Just like they're stupid enough to ignore that Trump's campaign manager, several of his campaign advisers, Torshin, Butina, and the whole cast of characters that put him in power are literally the same exact people who toppled the governments in at least 4 other countries at Putin's behest... and on his payroll.

Just like anyone who has bought into this gaslit narrative Russia's actions are no more of a threat to the U.S than other country has their head in the sand.  No wonder they keep targeting these fools for a never ending grift.  They can be convinced of anything.

Thank you for reminding us all that Trump while acting as the president of the United States lied to the U.S. citizens about bounties and still continues to choose what scraps of information he does share only for naked political gain with no regard for national security.   [deleted]   Sad you think Biden and McConnell are equivalent. That‚Äôs pretty out there. 

There will be no left leaning programs enacted. McConnell will still likely be in power in the senate. And if not, it will be a 50/50 split. Any enactment will be centrist and pragmatic. Bernie had his fair shot and the ‚Äòburbs and blue collar workers didn‚Äôt buy into him. 

Like it or not, it‚Äôs centrism all the way, baby.   I never realized that the constitution guaranteed a right to discomfort in my civic duty.   We attended a Jeep Jamboree in Kentucky years ago. Was told the highest cash crop was weed. Was told NOT to go off roading at night as we were likely to be shot/killed and disappeared because of drug production/moonshine.

Scary.   Well, he seems out of options now... Just pack and dream of another presidency.... Before prison...   *not enough*   ‚ÄúUseless old man yells at other useless old man‚Äù   [removed]   [removed]   His Chinese-born wife also has multiple business dealings, too.

That household is swimming in cash.   lol. I mean, he is/was trying to run for president; imagine if he did the same thing at the inauguration.   Fox News already has all the graphic organizers for 11:59PM talking about terrible budget balance, socialism on the rise, etc   If only true impartiality were possible.   Thank you Bernie. I dont agree with you on much, but this is a travesty. People are losing everything and need this.   I recommend you start learning Mandarin. You'll need it down the road.   Why has this not gotten more attention? It‚Äôs been 11 months‚Äîdid anything new ever develop after this?   29th dimensional chess   I hate that Roberts has become a moderate.

Not because he has moved left, but because America continues its suicidal drive to the right.   I've heard that too. Gatekeeping is weird. A smart population votes smarter. College or trade school is all but a requirement for a functional economy and democracy. All that money that's forgiven will send the economy, in a healthy way, through the roof. People will buy cars, houses, and necessities. Medicine!   &gt; but proposes banning passing down a thousand dollars.

You wanna back up that assertion with a quote? The article that *I* read proposed imposing a ""hard limit"" on inheritance, but didn't specify a particular dollar amount.   Doesn't change the fact that it's still travesty.   Lol I am sure he made more than that this week   [deleted]   Sure, but that's a bit different from a genetic predisposition toward addiction (as it requires an external environmental factor i.e., the mother using during pregnancy).

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*   Yes. This.   [removed]   I've seen repubs refute this by saying that: the polls were actually supporting MM fairly well just before the election, not by the margins he won by, but still up there, voter registration numbers are that high because people have never been deregistered after moving out of state etc, registered dems are 'legacy dems' but that's doesn't mean that's actually how they vote.

It is absolute fact that MM did tank *three* voting security bills.  I read up on them awhile back, and while I could see possibly acceptable reasons for tanking one, maybe two of them, the third flat seemed like a ""let's keep this from being able to be looked into"".  It is fact that KY has had voting machines from ES&amp;S since I believe 2005, and iirc the head of ES&amp;S is staunch republican, maybe even ran for office at one point?  Could be misremembering that bit, though.  But having voting machines with no paper record is idiotic no matter what.

And it *may* be true that the KY machines were some of the ones that had online access potential, don't remember on that one, but I know that some, nationally, did, which made them unconscionably vulnerable to hackers - including ones who could have altered the tallying immediately prior to the election, *and changed it back* immediately after.  But I don't know which counties/states had those machines and which didn't.

ETA: Maine at least (I have been told) has paper backups of every vote locked up somewhere.  So if true that state, at least, would be much more risky to cheat in... but the election was decisive enough that there won't be any recounts or checks done.   Inherited wealth establishes dynasties capable of controlling elected representatives through lobbying, PACs, campaign contributions and well-concealed ""understandings"" of all sorts. Democracy devolves into an effective plutocracy where the very top of the wealth pyramid can steer the nation instead of our democratically-elected leaders. Perpetual wealth allows a few idle rich to make decisions they should have no business making.

A good old progressive estate tax prevents this. The best tax is a tax that doesn't cost anyone alive, and this is it. The deceased is not in any position to suffer from it. The inheritors have not worked to earn this money so they aren't the ones paying the tax either. Everyone should work to earn their keep and nobody should be banking on someone else's death for their own income. The more estate tax is collected, the less income tax needs to be for everyone. Overall it's an excellent way to level the playing field for everyone.   Dems didn‚Äôt have the numbers in congress to change the results in 2000   Also fun: https://bagofdicks.com/   Can I just say. I love that BOTH of my senators are on your list   I have been saying it since the GOP started pushing this voter fraud BS. If they have no proof, then we can use the same argument against them, except ours makes more sense and explains their bullet points even better.   So say republicans with 7 digits on their hands.   well at least the turtle is right about one thing lol now give us those damn checks!   $600 was barely enough to keep me from downing in bills this month. Combined with what I was able to make I scrapped by. I‚Äôm still in roughly $1200 of debt though. Debt this pandemic forced me into. Fuck Mitch McConnell. It‚Äôs his fault I‚Äôm in debt. It‚Äôs his fault I‚Äôm stressed all the time. I hate him. He‚Äôs a cruel unrelenting fuckhead of a man who doesn‚Äôt deserve the position he holds over me.   $3300 that we know about*   [removed]   Fair enough   I‚Äôve got a 90wpm with accuracy typing speed at a standard keyboard. Considerably slower on mobile. I used to read novels on the toilet as a teen. Whole novels, like *Fellowship of the Ring*. I‚Äôm less communicative in person, but when I‚Äôm faced with text, it‚Äôs so much easier.

If you mean the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing that too much‚Äù message, I get that now and then too. It bugs the ever living crap out of me. Lol

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*   Holding one bill hostage for another isn't voting against your ideals.   How about some actual action?   The White House calling someone a liar. This White House calling anyone a liar? Okay.   His daughters are better off without him.  Hopefully they go on to study science.   Mitch probably meant rich in spirit. So Jesus of him, amirite?   Usually, but not in this particular instance.

If there was no hope of the checks passing, or Trump wouldn't sign it, yeah it would be stupid. But that's not the case. A vote would likely result in us getting the checks, this (and Schumer invoking his powers) was the only realistic way to force a vote to happen.   &gt; it isn't his role as president to determine who does or does not get prosecuted! 

and yet, you can be damn sure he will pardon a lot of people during his reign.   Fuck them! I hope Trump stays there forever! Terrorize   them!   I mean. This is is exactly what republicans do to get their way. They hold the government hostage, democrats capitulate. Remember ""the sequester""? Republicans pick shutdown fights all the time, and win almost every time. Democrats just aren't shrewd enough to hold their ground.   As a lifelong liberal I agree. Democrats suck at marketing.   &gt; I understand why Sanders wants to use it as leverage for the $2,000, but there is really no realistic way that is going to happen without taking the Senate from McConnell.

Did you see the vote totals? There were as many Republicans as Democrats voting against the override, and they need us to override the veto. Well, needed us.   Yeah. Agreed. To think where we'd be with Al Gore. 

Good thing Covid didn't happen in 2018 while Trump had 2 more year. Mitch would've let everyone die before cutting a dollar to the poor.   Please please please please....sue the S**T out of her!!!   Epstein is still hanging around ?         
Does he hang around with Olly ?      
Do they sway in a breeze ?     
Fuck them both.   The largest rat escaping from the sinking ship   They don‚Äôt like change. But it‚Äôs a big problem that their social baseline is the 1960s   Sure, let me just put on my bipartisan suit and pack my equal representation backpack, as I climb into my functional democracy cannon and fire off into cooperation land where the business of the government is to solve problems and build a better future. 

Sorry, this is 21st Century America. We believe everything is a zero sum game and it's much easier to fight for a bigger portion of the broken mess than it is to clean it up.   Don‚Äôt think Newsweek is pro trump, pro trump news is newsmaxx, OAN, Fox News and breitbart could be wrong tho   See when defund dropped I was like ""This is smart, it's concrete and easy to understand. It's different enough from abolish that people won't be crying about 'crazy abolitionists', but it's a concrete step in a direction that abolitionists and other people alike can get behind, especially now that how overfunded police departments are is getting so much attention"" but nope I was exactly wrong. But hey plenty of people also think ""Black Lives Matter""= ""I support anarchist Antifa terrorism,"" and I can't think of a more vanilla and agreeable slogan than that, so it may be more about the coverage and messaging surrounding the slogan than the slogan itself.   Originalism is an inherently flawed judicial philosophy utilized by the ingorrant and by bad faith actors to cover their personal activism. Utilizing Originalism as a judicial philosophy should be disqualifying for a municipal judge, let alone a Supreme Court Justice.

It's a terrible idea to bake in bad ideas and illogical ""thinking"" to our already broken legal system.   I want this fecally incontinent racist to be held accountable in court. I want to watch him forced to answer these charges in court under oath.   Disagree. I'm already seeing a decrease in Trump-related headlines and I'd wager they decrease as he becomes less and less relevant. Good riddance you orange piece of shit!   What is this guy‚Äôs problem?   No. Pass on that. Vote by mail, to this scale, was only needed because of covid and unfortunately vote by mail has only caused people to distrust and question voting security.   That honestly should've been plastered everywhere in KY. Billboards, tv, whatever the fuck people use nowadays, that should've been the Dems main message: ""Moscow Mitch hates First Responders"". God.   I agree with you and I hate it. She should have retired in 2012.   I think I know what you're referring to. More ""tribal"" mentality, as you said ""others"" outsiders, group is together w core beliefs such as religious, afraid of being attacked
 I can't for the life of me remember the part of the brain.  If I can in a while I'll look it up.   I hope someone can help explain this to me.  I feel like I have it wrong.  Is this saying that he‚Äôs keeping people from traveling or is it saying that it‚Äôs keeping people that are already here from getting things to stay in the country.  I‚Äôm horrible with politics and trying to understand this.   [removed]   Of course their going to lie its their modus operandi.   The lame ass dog Graham   Literally   &gt; The world is out to get them, apparently. My Mom genuinely believes that Biden's victory will mean the end of civilization as we know it, and she believes that Biden was sent by the devil.


I'm in the same boat. I got to hear about how Trump is more morale than Biden. My grandmother calls Tump her boyfriend.   [deleted]   They‚Äôll pass tax cuts for the rich. Just not tax cuts for the poor.   I'm just kind of gutted that not enough people had enough of what he'd done over the years to vote Mitch McConnell out. That's the thing. Bernie's trying to save us, which is great. But Mitch got there because enough people failed to see how horrible he is, or see him in a manner that's markedly different than I do. I just don't get it.

It's like if in John Wick, he went after the people who killed his dog and the majority of the people in his home town saw an article in the newspaper or online and said ""Yeah, but we like that guy!"" There's probably a better analogy, but you probably get the idea.   Are you personally never voting for any of these guys again, lol? 

Why would they care about how their actions make you feel?   True hackers would rename it to ‚ÄúHomework‚Äù. Mom‚Äôs never gonna look there.   Hi `qdude1`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, your submission has been removed for the following reason:

They did not base their actions on things they knew to be false.

An AG would have to show that the Reps knew the claims of voter fraud were false to make it stick.   It is NOT easy. But he is one of the unicorn conservatives who voted for Biden this election and whatever libertarian candidate last election. I cannot say there aren't huge fights over certain issues lol   [removed]   Rest of the Dems are tripping over each other trying to stab him in the back by voting to over-ride his filibuster. I mean, look at [this shit](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00290)...more Republicans voted against the motion to proceed than Democrats. What the fuck is that?!   Solarwinds does an assortment of things but we use it for server alert and monitoring that means the service account needs at least read access (shouldn't have write) to all servers it monitors. Solarwinds supply chain was exploited to have remote access to the service account via a signed dll (iirc). Nothing could have been done once it was slipped into the signed code. You don't use 2fa for service accounts lol   Sedition, yes. Treason, no. Treason requires helping an enemy in a time of war.   No you‚Äôre right. I just went to their website and looked at the titles of a bunch of their covers and articles. My mistake.   So basically they have advantages due to how the electoral college works, advantages because companies finance their campaigns, advantages because they blocked legislation that makes elections more secure and more transparent, and have a company supplying voting machines, which has very good chance of favoring them, and despite that they're claiming voter fraud, and that they actually won?   There would need to be a new system of counting votes or else any new ""three party system"" would revert back to a two party system.   But what will mother think.   Time to break the fatigues out, grab the AR15 and have me some Trump supporter cosplay.  No better metaphor for everything that is wrong with America.   The Democrats are already losing to Republicans. They lost seats in the house and need a miracle to take the senate. Nobody wants those fucking milquetoast centrist plans that the dems roll out in the hope of not making conservatives who will never vote for them mad. They are already trying to blame losses not on themselves and their shit policy, but defund the police.   Pence should resign in protest

saying he wants nothing more to do with Trump techically though

Pence has the power to go to the cabnit and remove Trump from office temporarly for being unfit for duty.   but NOPE. 

Pinhead pence wont do anything   Yeah it‚Äôs still just the nut jobs of the tea party. The ignorantly proud torch bearers of the know nothing party and the John Birch Society.   &gt; We just prefer to attack Democrats for not trying harder.

They could at least try at all. This was just a complete surrender.   But Bernie couldn‚Äôt the primary. America needs to sort it out   [deleted]   I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be able to get rid of it, as they‚Äôd need a supermajority to approve that, assuming no republicans would vote with them for removal, which seems unlikely...   I don't find it odd at all, but I think im far more cynical about the motivations behind most Democratic party congressional reps.   All states should have mandatory audits/paper recounts, and the funding to run them, obv.

But all states should also have independent redistricting too, probably assisted by AI that analyzes population density &amp; geography.   False statements are the white house's currency, though, so they can't possibly be bad when made by someone else, right white house?   Dems should have asked that ALLL each and every state's voting machines be audited for posterity. It would have answered the trump lackeys calls and then also looked into their sketchy wins. If they were against it then we'd be asking why   Ooh we could send them dicks too. Lindsay might be late to Senate if we send some to him.

In my defense, I did not expect having to debate the meaning of the word ""genocide""   A good rule of thumb: anything willing to be said in a hotel ballroom hearing, but not in actual court, is probably not a credible statement.

Now that is a moronic idea.   Kentucky should become their own country and McConnell can be the leader of the poorest country in the world!!   Says the old rich guy from a racist and federal aid dependent state, that contributes next to nothing to the real economy, and is best known for giving lung cancer to the world.   Evil never dies....unfortunately   [removed]   This isn't really accurate. Vaccinations are going slowly globally not just in the US. This is what I hate about US media. 

There are multiple reasons. Most are global . 

1- a lack of vaccine supply due to production times and demand 

2- a huge global demand

3 - US has limited production , the 2nd vaccine just got authorized.

4- US is distributing at the state level 

5- US states prioritize the medical and first responders first 

6- general population will be the last to get the vaccine after first responders , elderly , and likely teachers.

7- authorities at all levels including the new administration already said widespread vaccination would take a year or more.   They should just quit the Republican Party already. We all know that they are going to flock to whatever alternate party Trump creates as a final fuck you to Mitch.   Ahem. Have you tried

&gt; Wrong.

yet?   True but a not insignificant portion of those will be republicans and that's one hell of a silver lining   I agree, but I just refuse to use ""/s.""  The real ""job creator"" is demand for goods and services.  The supply of jobs is created by the demand for the labor, and that demand comes only from consumers.   Thank you for doing the right thing, and thank you for facing the cold to vote, every vote counts!   ""[Police] also determined that the girlfriend was in need of ‚Äúpsychological evaluation,‚Äù and she was taken to a hospital [after reporting Warner for bomb making]."" 

So she went to the authorities over a year ago with her concerns and the authorities concluded SHE was the mentally unstable one. jfc   It seems like this time Republicans are even mad at Mitch. Now we just have to hope that they don't forget about it in 2 weeks.   That‚Äôs only if someone doesn‚Äôt get 270 electoral votes.

That only happens if the House throws out votes.   He's such a blob of shit.   Tuh-ray-tors.  Seditious, soulless, soviet-suckered, self-absorbed shitheads.   [removed]   While this is the way of the internet you clearly did not look up the facts if you think my post was ""claiming"" facts. Nice to see pardons being used on good people instead of murderers.   [deleted]   imagine if bernie was our elect or our president through covid times.   Gotta stop the bleeding before you can excise the cancer   CNN fact checks dems,  who fact checks republicans?  Certainly not fox news, OAN or breitbart.   ""We made corporations rich enough to help you. What more do you want from us""?   Really? I thought Bourbon had to be made in Bourbon County, KY to be called Bourbon, sort of like Champagne only being made in Champagne, France, and Scotch only being able to be called Scotch if it was made in Scotland.

Until they ""do him a favor?""   NATO is already imbedded in most of those bases. They're going to be attacked too.   Treason is helping an enemy in a time of war. It‚Äôs definitely not treason   &gt;  Interesting that you‚Äôre pulling weight for Republicans, while the vast majority of Democrats support what I said. Disgusting.

I'll continue to GOTV for democrats in Georgia and will be ensuring the polls are safe and secure when I work the polls on the 5th. You can continue to try to divide the party, but don't worry, I'll do more than post on reddit and will keep fighting for ya hun.   Republican majority leader pile of shit McConnell from Kentucky the most poor and parasitic state in the USA, this guy is angry was bullied for polio and grew up a cretin   There was a lot of cheating in Florida that never was challenged at a national level. I remember one newspaper article , probably hard to find now on the web (I have tried), which talked about a truck filled with ballots disappearing for hours, then suddenly showing up again

Democrats are not fighters. Not for generations. Sure, there are a few that are ornery and not politically correct.  But mostly they respect another's space, and don't like causing waves. If I were less polite, the word ""wimps"", and ""fluff"" would be mentioned

Its only an accident that national leaders with no stomach to fight became the core of the only functioning government   The same reason we let them live, it is their right.

Yeah what‚Äôs his alternative ‚Äútargeted stimulus‚Äù? Non-fucking existent. I think targeted stimulus would be way better, but the republicans have offered jack shit. All they want to do is sit around and criticize everyone else‚Äôs ideas.   (Chinese heiress)   [deleted]   Ohmfg dont make republicans like her even more.

Cost of construction is high in the high cost of living areas. Easily $700k for a modest house. The land isn't free either of course.

Even though the ACA has obvious holes in it, Obama and Biden have already insured tens of millions more people than Bernie ever will. His beliefs and convictions aren't worth anything if he refuses to develop the skills that make a good politician. 

I'm not even American, my guy. I can't be a true patriot.   What‚Äôs your idea of a ton? Where do you live?   An old crusty hypocrite communist who is hell bent on destroying American prosperity will be nothing but a leach. If you want communism or socialism, please find the exit. Those philosophies are the antithesis of what America was founded on and goes against everything that has made this country the freest, most prosperous nation the world has ever known. It‚Äôs not a perfect place, but I dare you to find a place that is better.

If it passes, we should coordinate spending it all locally wherever possible.   McConnell has been representing those counties for over 30 yrs.

Isn't that just the excuse?

If ""punishment"" is supposed to stop ""wickedness"" why are red states still such shitholes?

Have they not been deprived enough yet?   A complete fracture of the modern GOP would be great. Buckley-Conservatives and Evangelical Tea Party really don‚Äôt have much in common other than ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù   Gassing peaceful protestors in Lafayette Square (who weren't even violating curfew) to have a fucking photo op in front of a church? Spreading lies about the legitimacy of an election he rightly lost so that he can stay in power? Pardoning war criminals?   We are going to identify you as being someone who will agree with everything we say ‚Äúconservative‚Äù before we allow you to post. Then we make it flair only, look at how many people agree with our views!

Check out this echochamber I made!   &gt;...which is ironic because it is clear as day that Trump is faking his faith.

Trump awkwardly holding up the Bible after the Lafayette Square gassing is one of the most surreal things I've seen over the past four years. I don't understand how anyone could look at that photo-op and conclude anything other than Trump being a caricature of a pious politician.   Paywalled. üôÑ   I'm *not* saying he isnt someone who gets sexual gratification out of watching people die in poverty, but is there *any* evidence that he doesnt?   &gt;two of my close friends are married to local police officers

There it is.   It‚Äôs great that trump has made it A-okay to be an ass and greitens is coming back. Love America. /s   If you read about the brain differences of conservatives and others, it is very interesting. And apparently, 30%(i think) or so are born with their brain wired conservative.   Ay, D's finally playing hardball   Meanwhile our vp elect votes in favor of Mitch McConnell. Is there no shame? Ridiculous.   Go Bernie!   Strom Thurmond is the same racist piece of shit that basically raped his 15 year old black house maid. People like to water it down, but he was 22 years old at the time, and had sex with a child that his family employed. The young teen had a daughter from their encounter, which he basically kept a secret, so he could keep being a segregationist politician. Sick shit.   [deleted]   According to Trump, Biden has low energy, and according to Kanye, Trump has dragon energy, so it's clearly true, Trump won. It's simple logic.   How about you start naming names, the GOP has to clean its own house so you got your work cut out for you Ben.   ... because elections are perfectly flawless.   Fuck Mitch McConnell.   The Democrats could and should have held the government hostage. The eyes of the whole country were on them and they shrugged and put their hands back in their pockets.  Do you think Georgians who notice that the Democrats make no effort to help them during this pandemic and downturn when it actually matters will say:  ""Oh yes I am now motivated to go and vote in these runoff elections.""   Not sure either, but I doubt there's a deadline for the senate to vote on the bill, so MM can just schedule the vote for ""when we have time for it"".

If there was a ""Must vote within X time"" requirement, the house could flood the senate with so many junk bills that they couldn't get much of their own work done.   False Statements is different from Fake News, right?   He is killing no one check and see how many people are killed by destracted driving is that the governments fault also   He and Rudy look like they could be related. Maybe it's just the crazy eyes, though.   We have speculation based on some data we don‚Äôt understand; however, the cost - benefit of figuring out election security protocols is much needed.   *Cowabunga*   A silver tongue is a necessity for genderfluid people like me to ever be accepted. I have to be able to reach people despite their prejudices or I'll always be a punchline and never be accepted for the person I am.   Well, in NC I don't think that's the narrative at all (I live there). Cal Cunningham was an unexciting candidate to begin with, but he was polling well and likely could have eeked out a win. But then he decided to sext someone in the closing stages of the race. I don't like that Schumer allegedly selected Cal to begin with, but had he not started thinking with his other head, I think he could have won. Instead, we get 6 more years of ""representation"" from Thom fucking Thillis.   Oh, okay, Mr. Humblebrag Worthington III, Esq.   And, as I already clearly said in my first post, there is zero evidence of them doing anything to pressure the one person with the power to pass it to do anything. Even the spineless puppet Lindsey Graham has publicly called for McConnell to bring it to a vote. Purdue and Loffler have done shit except say they support it on the campaign trail. It would take 3 Republicans to side with the Democrats and remove Mitch. If they support it then why aren't they doing anything about it? Politics has gone to shit in this country because gullible people like yourself believe blatant lies and ignore actions.   I think the real question is why doesn't it not have more downvotes? ü§î   From what I hear, it hasn‚Äôt really improved his game.   Also one issue voters like my Grandmother. Mexican Immigrant that came here from when she was a teenager, life long republican even with all their anti-immigrant/brown person rhetoric.   Are you worried that every Democrat that opposed universal Medicare lost their elections this year?   &gt;Mr Wood has also suggested that supporters of Mr Trump stock up on ""Second Amendment supplies"" ahead of the inauguration of Joe Biden.

You know, if he was a person of colour suggesting this, the police blowback would be a lot stronger

&gt;Justice Scalia was nearly 80 years old with a history of high blood pressure and heart issues.

It's like Roberts somehow *knew* that Scalia was likely to die   The point is that there needs to be an investigation to look for evidence dipshit.   Plot twist: let‚Äôs not count their votes to not count votes.

In fact, assuming they continue on as Congressmen, let‚Äôs not count their votes on anything ever again. Toobadsosad.   It's the corner stone of democracy though. Voting is just the start. As a citizen you also make sure your vote is counted (preferably at the value of 1 Vote - 1 Vote and that no vote is wasted). If congress just ignores your vote, you as a citizen need to take it up with them. I do agree that the design of modern democracy needs to be revisited because of the diversity in the the demographics and beliefs we have in the modern era.   Damn it OBAMA!!!!


/s   The Feels over Facts lot are not actually in a position to do anything. McTurtle has conceded Biden won, he can't override the constitution in less than 3 weeks, so he has no choice. 

Trump's coup required more loyal people to him than to the constitution and he hasn't got enough in the key places.   Then it would have been four more years of Trump.   Feel the Bern!   Kentucky has continued to vote for him for 30+ years. I think it's pretty clear nothing will change their mind. The issue isn't that McConnell is a piece of shit. The issue is that 1 man, elected by a single state, has the ability to block legislation by himself.   The stepped-up basis tax provision for for the transfer of capital assets following the death of a parent/relative is ludicrous. It allows wealthy people the ability to eradicate their capital gains tax; which is already taxed favorably. It's absolute BS.   He wouldn't be the president in a week anyway. Why would he care about starting a war? He can just leave the country.   Could?   He has been the only one truly fighting the poor/working class. He‚Äôs always been a national treasure   You do you bud   Not anyone's fault that not every area wants a super progressive person representing them in Congress. 

If you think the races in KY, SC, etc were lost because the candidates didn't go far enough to the left, you're wrong. If they had run a Sanders or AOC style democratic socialist, they would have lost by even more. 

We should be pushing really progressive candidates in places that are already safely blue, and more moderate candidates in places that are afraid to even vote Democrat at all.   Not just this but the Senate is a *supermajoritarian* institution due to the filibuster. It requires 2/3 rather than 1/2 to A) bring a bill to the floor and B) vote on the bill. 

Unfortunately this is  by design: http://hnn.us/articles/1139.html

The US Senate was supposed to be a slow, stop-gap institution.

I don't agree with it and I think our founders were wrong when they made it the way it is. It should be changed.   To be fair Obama aligns more republicans when it comes to republicans because he favors an intervention foreign policy and Market driven solutions to societal issues like healthcare. R politics is not even left. It‚Äôs more center and center right.   He‚Äôs hiding he can‚Äôt handle the truth!!!!   He probably made more than that to be honest. Probably has assets and investments.   I just call people whatever they ask me to (within reason, otherwise I use their name ...or trans/non-binary. Or a general pronoun such as ""they, them""). That is a bit annoying in terms of separating plurality and individuality...but I am ok with dancing around words a little bit...so long as things remain rational.

Perhaps my mode of thought is not perfect...but I tend to view gender as just 1 single spectrum(well 2 spectrums, biological and neurological. If you really wish to...I suppose you could add sociological to that and get a 3 dimensional ""vector""*) *probably not the best term) instead of a collection of various points of identity that must be categorized.

(-1, 1) Just pick a floating point somewhere in that range and whatever the fuck ever? Live life and do what you want? The sad truth is? I cannot devote a ton of time to worrying about it. I am only concerned with respect towards others, and my own participation in this world.   Parler's not gonna like this.   [deleted]   [deleted]   Bernie does so much for us   Pretty sure the headline 2 weeks ago was, ‚Äú Americans think elected officials should be among the first to get the covid 19 vaccine.‚Äù   Sounds like I could make some real money down there.   To be fair, most violent acts have increased this year   It‚Äôs all projection, because he thinks that if Trump would think to do it, everyone else would, because who‚Äôs smarter than Trump?   Spot on. An old roommate of mine was from Kentucky and this is EXACTLY how their extended family was. It‚Äôs quite terrifying.   This guy needs to be dragged out of the Whitehouse.

It sucks that a handful of people in Kentucky are able to make these decisions for the rest of the country.   My bugs... My bugs... My lovely ladybugs!   Politicians should be making far less a year in general but during a pandemic they shouldn't be making more than that they give their people.   Bet u dont go   [removed]   There's a reason people get more conservative with age, you begin seeing society for what it is, and the rosy picture of poor people as being ""unlucky"" or ""disadvantaged"" goes away as you experience these shitstains mooching off of your hard work.   these people live to be 100   That‚Äôs probably more time than he has spent sleeping in the last four years.   Ammunition?  The Republicans have shown *constantly* that they don't require ammunition: they just point their fingers and yell ""bang!"", and their constituents declare ""they got you, you're dead, fall down!"".

Mitch was up there flat out lying about the $2k checks, calling them ""socialism for the rich"".  If the Democrats presented a united front, actually *fought* for the $2k checks, and spoke openly and honestly about Republican obstruction, then they could actually have a say in the political optics for a change.

I will never fathom why there are so many Democrats whose chief strategy is ""show the Republicans our belly and hope their leg gets tired from kicking us"".  The Democratic party is fucking addicted to failure.   There what is?   Kamala voted progressive when it didn‚Äôt matter for the optics. No senator is as progressive or has a track record like Bernie, and that‚Äôs by design. They don‚Äôt usually let people like Bernie into the senate, as he has acknowledged in the past.   Tell me again about how both parties are the same...   elected officials need to be thrown on a island like survivor   Ok.   Also doesn't help that they barely ever get out of their home counties to see how the rest of the country ‚Äî nevermind the world ‚Äî does things.   Time for some trickle up economics Mitch!!!   Edit:
This mofo will probably stick around for a long time coming too. These old politicians live forever it seems. Not surprising since, you know, 
They sign a pact with satan and all.   Oh God, I froth at the mouth whenever I hear latin phrases   Please! Yes!!!   Murderer.   McConnell is complaining about holding up the sacred cow military spending, but a lot of service members and families would benefit from an increased stimulus payout.   Bernie must be questioning if he's doing the right thing after all, if slime like Graham and Trump are on his side.   I dont think political speech or official votes have ever been considered even liable for fraud charges.  I'm not sure that's a good thing, mind you.   I drove through Georgia yesterday, and the ads on the radio were outright fabricated lies and defamation.  I‚Äôm seriously appalled at how slanderous and toxic the GOP is.   As long as there is agreement towards the system being fair, that's the best we can get. The variables towards influencing the probability distribution are endless but usually ignored. For example, what if the sides of the coin are not equal in weight like most currency? What if the computer we're running our selection on is currently cooling at a consistent rate. What influence will that have on our transistors? What influence will this have on the algorithms speed and thus selection bias?

Those are reasonable confounding variables that will influence our distribution. Still, the gravitational pull of Pluto for all I know may alter the distribution slightly. All we can hope to say is it's statistically irrelevant and we can hope to say that if our system is engineered well to be isolated from that influence or mitigate the influence. Still, the influence is not zero, it's just usually unknown.   I'm so glad you got out. like a lot of people I'm trying to navigate how to help friends and fam who've been indoctrinated into the qcult. It's been harrowing. 

Question: when you sought CBT was it for conspiracy beliefs or for your depression and anxiety? Which came first?

[deleted]   [deleted]   well at least 140 republifcans in the house also feel the same way

jerks   That also strikes me as a reasonable guess, based on the evidence.   It would be helpful in context to know why he voted yes then. Often, someone even as principled as him votes against their history as a matter of some unpublicized amendment or pork. This happens on both sides of the spectrum.   The person I'm responding to implied that ""one side doesn't vote for party only"" when yes, democrats absolutely do that too. Here you are proving it.   [deleted]   [removed]   This guy is a gift that keeps giving.   This is exactly it. Republican voters think Trump is the answer. I‚Äôve even seen some pastors with a public ministry claiming voter fraud from their pulpit. One even compared battling this election and the incoming candidate as good vs evil. I won‚Äôt go back to church until a President is sworn in.   If he just would have asked for a year off for golfing we would have given it to him...   Don't Representatives have a Oath of Office?  Something about protecting the constitution and faithfully serving their country?

When a doctor violates his oath, he loses the right to practice medicine...   [deleted]   Anyway   Rest of the Dems are tripping over each other trying to stab him in the back by voting to over-ride his filibuster. I mean, look at this shit...more Republicans voted against the motion to proceed than Democrats. What the fuck is that?!   [removed]   The Q conspiracies about pedophiles run counter to the Q conspiracies about pedophiles.  There's no internal consistency at all.   [removed]   My shop teacher told us: ""If you have to tell someone you are something, you're not."" I think it was probably one of the best life lessons I learned and took to heart.   [deleted]   Lemmings, all of em.   What makes my opinion ""old and tired""?  And why does everything that doesn't align with your world view immediately get discounted as disingenuous? 


I mean, you've said nothing of substance.  Your reason for doing college loans over other programs was not because it is sound use of tax dollars, instead you think it's good because it's literally the easiest solution to implement because of the executive order.  That doesn't make it good policy.  


You're conflating military spending failures with whether or not it is appropriate to implement every single solution ever proposed to solve every societal problem.   The failure of one doesn't mean we get to let Democrats fail too because of some made up moral high ground.   You're detached from reality.   I believe it‚Äôs meant to provoke a response and when it was a grassroots thing, it worked, but this isn‚Äôt gonna get your suburban moms on board. I agree with the sentiment, but not the branding at all. I really wish the movement would re brand their idea, but since there‚Äôs no firm coalition, who can do that? We need a galvanizing figure like that can get this shit done.   What do you think is gonna happen in Dc with his call to the ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù? I believe I saw videos of people beaten a couple a month ago.   All the polling was strongly in his favor just like the election results. They voted him in. Approval rating is nearly meaningless. If they hated him, they hated McGrath more.   [Jenny Cohn](https://twitter.com/jennycohn1) has been screaming about this for years to journalists, news media, and politicians and has been rebuffed by all except Ron Wyden I think.   They can't. They don't control the House. All they can do is maybe delay things a bit. GOP does control the Senate, but you'd need both chambers to agree to override it, otherwise it defaults to passing. 

I'm now downplaying the seriousness of this open sedition. Or that it will have long term effects. But Biden will be sworn in.   Reaction will still be the same.   Argentina   I'm a pinko lefty radical, but I like JBE. I'd be pissed if we elected him in VA but it's kind of amazing that he was elected in Louisiana, let alone re-elected. 

He's a conservative dem, but he's got decent positions on a lot of issues. And he's from Tangipahoa Parish which is like, wild to me. 

I also never let it pass without mentioning that the only reason he stood a chance in the first place is because Jindal fucked the state budget so bad it actually got republicans to vote for a democrat. A tangipahoa parish dem, but nevertheless, kind of miraculous.   [removed]   [deleted]   The scare tactics would seem a lot more credible. 

Instead of saying that the candidate was a puppet of the extreme left, they would be able to say that the candidate is the leader of the extreme left.   I agree that Loeffler and Perdue think Congress has done enough, but even if they didn't, it's worth voting for the Dems just to get McConnell out of the majority leader's office.  He is a roadblock to all progress.   &gt;	make the ~~masses~~ poor as dumb as possible.   Even then, that's not an outcome where the NDAA doesn't get passed, only delayed (except in the sense that it's technically a different bill with the same contents).   Any good recipe for terrorists involves unresolvable humiliation plus a feeling of unsolvable helplessness. Thanks, Republicans!   &gt;Was he normal before hand?

He was a Republican so probably not.   The PPP loans in the US are that.  They are loans given to businesses that are forgiven if they don't lay off employees.    What makes  you an expert?   to be fair he is right

but give us those damn checks lol   They didn‚Äôt specify one on US Soil.   ""Testimony""

Ha ha ha ha! A hotel ballroom is not court. As batshit crazy as Trump's legal team is, even they're not stupid enough to lie about pretend fraud in actual court.   ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how Trump can still win‚Äù   Yep. I get so fucking mad thinking about how the DNC snubbed him twice. He could have done what every other politician who ""loses"" does and disappear, but the man can't stop fighting for us.   Any work he's doing is criminal in nature...perfect place to do it is in the middle of a golf course.   [deleted]   They‚Äôll move the goal posts again somehow. The end game is them supporting Trump financially for the rest of his life by teasing a return to the White House after it was ‚Äústolen‚Äù from him.   And yeah, the man should be tried for treason and then promptly executed, publicly, as an example.   Lol if you don't realize Trump is petty enough to literally stage a domestic terror event or start WWIII in a desperate bid to hang on to power and stay out of prison

No time to worry about congressional stuff when they need to hit the ground running and Trump is preventing that.    I'm pretty convinced that there's a very large, younger, left vote that needs progressive candidates to get them to get up and vote and that Centrist Dems lose the young vote, even when the progressive candidate supports the centrist that gets the nomination   [idontbelieveyou.gif](https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-a6YHwnkn0ctOM)   MF murderer!

Our prospects for the future look promising.   The bill house democrats wrote increasing the stimulus payment to $2000 had no other legislation attached. When he spoke on the floor McConnell very clearly said he believes the American people do not need this money and debating the bill would be flirting with socialism.   georgia also has paper ballots.

Ah fuck I just realized J. Markey and and Jeff Merkley are not the same person   And shit here I am worried my $600 is gonna get lost in the wash.  Every one of my friends and close family that was eligible got there's already.( I got the last one so I would have to eligible right?)   We are taking about MSFT internal security issues, though.   Vote. It doesn't matter if 100% of conservatives say they won't vote. It doesn't matter if 100% of conservatives stay home. Go out and vote like yours is the winning vote, because that's how collective decision-making works. No one person's vote is the winning vote, the winning vote is every vote of every voter who voted for the winner.   Yup. So why keep posting the same articles   [removed]   I know it‚Äôs been said but goddamn. I adore Bernie &amp; we don‚Äôt deserve him.   Listen ladies and gents. Mitch is not going to change his mind. If the GOP gave a shit, they would replace him as speaker so the bills wouldn't die on his desk. Mitch is just taking the blame because he doesn't care and just won his reelection so is safe for a few years.   If you‚Äôre a salaried employee and still have the same job as before the pandemic, why is stimulus necessary? I understand helping those in need, but hand outs to everyone is extreme.   The limit wouldn't matter, so you open a dozen charity shells instead of one. You're rich, you have the incentive to go the extra mile.   Well then, let's lock these motherfuckers up!   He's trying to get Donald declared the winner, but I don't think he's actually worked directly for Trump.   He doesn‚Äôt work or live in the White House... Congress is down the street   I think it is the shit blocking that might be affecting his thinking and choices LOL

A good probiotic might help that :)

/s   I can't tell you how disappointed I was when that happened.   Thanks for all that. I've been wondering about exactly those questions.   What about the 6 billion to Israel? Doesn't every Israeli deserve $5,000 per person in aid collected from taxes of people they will never meet? /s   The thing is, what makes america awesome is if we dont like something, its in our rights to vote and protest. We make petitions and we put it to a vote to get this person out. I know its a little more complicated but he works for us, we pay for his fucking salary and his LIFE LONG healthcare benefits. Ive been unemployed since march cause the restaurant industry is being crippled, and ive been literally been in survival mode since march, im exhausted. This turtle faced taint licker thinks its in 'his' best interest to uphold money to save people's lives. Vote this dude out, this should be illegal on what he's doing ESPECIALLY during this time.   [removed]   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTjMqda19wk   Fantastic! Thank you! This will give me a good start in researching this more closely.   Who benefits more? Jeff from people spending a measly $2,000 or the banks when they scoop up a bunch of houses from people who default on their mortgage?   https://youtu.be/Ntl5Da1vblI

It's a masterpiece of an interview.   Go get em, Bernard.   Really confused about the status of this. Anyone got the good links?   Correct!   To be fair, I think a lot of public comments like this are for lifelong republicans to steel themselves into leaving their former party. Not all will do it, but some do. I saw a guy on Quora who was originally semi-pro Trump, and gradually went more and more in the Biden camp, to the point where he is an ardent Biden defender.   Yes. Before election day, I thought there was half a chance Trump would be recognized winner through cheating or that the US would be in a state of civil war. Because they had everything they needed to make either of these outcomes happen, and they showed the will to go to extremes to keep power.

I had underestimated their incompetence though.   I get your point, that old white lawyers and corporate stooges run the government, but just being old is not a disqualifier. Vermonters LOVE Bernie...of both parties.   That‚Äôs hot.   Funny but predictable.   Not the other guy, but I assume he's saying to try to buy local. Local business closing left and right, meanwhile amazon make a billion a week.

Some place made web portal to help you find local business that delivers.   Just like the corporate wing of Labour fought to handicap Corbyn   [deleted]   I already said you are probably correct in that they are only doing it for votes... I 100% agree with your *speculation*. But do not let speculation construe fact. The fact is that they vocally supported it. While that doesn‚Äôt really do anything, they do officially support it. 

Politics are a mess and they are shit senators that deserve to be removed from office. I‚Äôve donated to ossoffs and warnocks campaigns. 

Tone down your rage man.   Trump is not going to prison.   If you voted for this ass hole you can suck it!!   What is he boasting about?  That he has killed more Americans through his mismanagement and negligence than were killed in combat in WWII?  Yet Trump is still more concerned about himself than anything else.  Can a republican respond to how they can still support a jerk like this?   That‚Äôs exactly what I said, CNN is highly factual, but they‚Äôre still a dumpster fire of an organization beholden to corporate interests who report on politics like they‚Äôre sports.   Where did the $2000 figure even come from? This shit is all smoke and mirrors to keep the media and the people occupied while they fuck us blind   Boy howdy. I'd smugly adjust my glasses and let the plebes suck on THAT one.   Turning rubles into dollars   Look, Jack, my good friend Chris Crisco Christie learned his lesson and i hope that he will convince Donald Trump to wear a mask and promote Americans to wear a mask.  The vaccines are here and ive restored the soul of the nation.  I want us to vaccinate 100 million people in my first 100 days where we are only doing 10k a day now and i will be asking congress to pass a bill that will not get past the senate for more funding to get masks and 100 million vaccines into people in my first 100 days.  Like how vaccines simply existing will restore the economy, asking Congress to increase funding for vaccine distribution means that 100 million will be distributed in 100 days, Jack!   \[In the voice of Bruce from Family Guy\] ""Well, somebody's gotta eat all them little aphids now, don't they? I can do 50 a day! Yummy!""   [deleted]   [deleted]   So I‚Äôm confuse, I thought electing Biden meant we were going to get more stimulus checks . Now we need to get these two people also? What if works, do we get it then or will there be another issue   Say whatever you want about Bernie but he is one of the few politicians that actually genuinely cares about the people   Oh god the counting is going to be a nightmare with all the GOP watchers gunning to find fraud under every ballot. If a counter scratches their ass they'll claim it as fraud.   And unlike her political cronies that set her up, she will face time   I upvoted you because I agree   Because the news cycle had been dominated with ""Trump says"" and ""Sources familiar with Trump's Thinking Say"" headlines instead of actual important news stories.   Very America 1st of them   I love to see Bernie go mortal combat on that turtles ass

It almost definitely would have been cheaper to have him in the Oval Office instead of on the green. Whether you count that as a bad thing partly depends on whether you‚Äôre a fiscal conservative. When we say he should have been doing more, we mean more that‚Äôs useful and appropriate as president. Sitting on a toilet trolling and misinforming Twatter isn‚Äôt useful, except as ammo. He never managed to repeal and replace the ACA, never had a concrete plan, and here we are in a pandemic. Y‚Äôknow?

But yeah. There‚Äôs next to nothing Trump has done that I am aware of that has helped anything outside his circle of cronies and cons. Pardon the impotent rage at four wasted years.   My heart broke as a 43 year old father watching the generations behind me meme politics to death in 2016 and 2020 and then not go out and vote.   Where's all the worthless neoliberals talking about how Harris and Biden were the best pick for the election? Notable absence of any of their influence to help the american people.

Who could have seen this coming except everyone with even a smidgen of political literacy.   [deleted]   Why is this not higher?   [removed]    That myth was only ever believed by Americans.   Cutting back student loan balances is a ridiculous thing to do. It‚Äôs putting bumble gum on one hole on a sinking submarine.

 This was never about providing enough protections for the average American.  The problem has always been scale, and Trump's administration totally blew the pooch on this one.   


 No matter how history writes this story, it needs to be acknowledged that from recent history..  This shit will continue to happen even into the future.  Americans are short memory lived, and constantly need reminding that we will always have idiots in government making mistakes. Preventable...  

rant

 So...  Warp Speed wasn't about making sure there would be enough vaccine for everyone, it was making sure the vaccine existed.  Trump's administration, didn't order enough, Trumps administration didn't advice or help the CDC and FDA, to test and approve the vaccine.  The private labs of the expensive pharma corps, got paid.  The manufacturing process for the vaccine after the three phase testing, was ramped up long before the public was told. 

 Any yet, the roll out of the vaccine to where it is needed, is ""shorted"".  As far as I know, we are already expecting a New Years BOOM! of covid-19 infections in two weeks.  A new viral strain of covid has been detected.  This was expected once the virus was first announced. We NEEDED to stop the spread back in April.  But we didn't.    


 Now, we wait for the next pharma's to manufacture vaccines.  By mid-Jan 2021 400k+ Americans will have died from covid-19. And maybe by May, most Americans will have access to the vaccine.  Few Americans will refuse to take the vaccine, and we will still have  idiots refusing to wear masks, in some SovCit bull. 

&amp;#x200B;

 /crazy rant    ""It is disappointing""   These people pretend they are mad and/or pretend they are on your side.  They wanna fight to get you the money you deserve.  Bullshit.  These people are all the same, all of them.  The same people that locked you down and told you not to go outside are the same ones acting like they care.  Piss off.  Your a dumbass if you can‚Äôt see this.   Funny how the hoaxers were the first   Thank you!  I heard the number 57 and I thought I heard my local news say 57 doses.  Now I'm not sure what I actually heard.   God willing   Why are you not getting it?   Sorry for any typos or repeated words, im just upset tryna get frustrations out.   No you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment.

Is this a trick question?   Pretty sure that's just his senate salary which is probably only like 10% of his income   China‚Äôs a dictatorship so there‚Äôs a difference. For a scenario like this for America, it‚Äôd just be a democracy where one party continuously rules for who knows how long due to the other causing so much damage that they‚Äôre now third party level.   As someone who protested police brutality this summer, I was taken aback by the term ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù. I wanted *reform*, not to just stop paying them or abolishing them.

I get what the idea means after looking into it, but that‚Äôs the problem right off the bat with the slogan - anyone who only looks at things at a surface level is immediately not going to buy into that idea. I agree that people should do more research into ideas like this, but many just *won‚Äôt* because of the first impression it makes.

Everytime McConnell kills a bill instead of getting outraged at the unprecedented level of obstruction he and the Republican party have taken part in the past decade, people on the left look for a way to blame Democrats. 

It's always Democrats fault that the bill they voted on and verbally supported by the guy with most power in the Senate, because they are corporate owned or whatever. You're doing McConnell's, Loeffler's and Perdue's work for them right now.

[deleted]   No offense, but a majority of the country voted against their own self interest. The wealthy have been winning every election for my entire lifetime. Everyone is voting for who they perceive is the ""lesser of two evils""; we're just going through a cycle that is progressively getting worse.

Not only do we just accept this nonsense system year after year, we actively convince others to accept it too out of fear for the other side.

I don‚Äôt know how legit this site or ‚ÄúSurvey USA‚Äù is but this seems to be a direct result of Trump butting heads with the GOP.   Good, Dems go out and vote   Math doesn't check out then.   No shit.   We had a ballot discussion group on zoom, where we went over all the options, people gave opinions and information about different candidates and ballot measures. Made for much more informed voting, especially since it can be difficult to find much information about some of the less publicised local races.   He can bring his old ass here to Minnesota and kiss my big ass!!!   [removed]   And yet he keeps fighting for us. He's practically the only person in our government that even remotely gives a fuck about the people he represents.   &gt; I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the founders intended to over-represent the minority.

Yes and no.

When we have these discussions, we have to keep in mind that we _do not_ have the exact system the founders designed. We've tinkered with it in several ways that have drastically changed it. Two ways in particular come to mind.

The first is the size of the house. When the country was founded, each representative stood for about 30,000 people. Now its over 700,000 people. Why, you ask? Because the size of the House was capped at 435 back in the 1920s by a law passed by congress, and it has not increased since. Why 435? That happened to be how much space they had in the room the House meets in. 

The effect of this is two fold. The first is that smaller states, which are guaranteed at least 1 representative, have far more power than then they had originally. This is because a state like Wyoming has 1 rep for 500,000 people, while California has 1 per 750,000. Basically, the people of Wyoming are over represented, and California people are under. 

The second effect is to give the smaller states more power in the Electoral college, since the number of electoral votes is equal to the number of senators plus representatives a state has.  

The second significant change was the move to have Senators popularly elected. Originally, they were appointed by the state legislatures. The idea was that the senators represented the states _as political entities_, rather than representing the people of the state. Senators were basically diplomats sent from the states to the federal government, and the Vice President was the diplomat sent from the federal government to the states. This was the reason for having the number be the same for all states; they represented the _state_ not the _people_ of the state. 

Making the senators popular elected increased the over representation of citizens in the smaller states relative to the large states. Senators are no longer answerable to the state governments they represent, and instead now represent the people of them. Too, it essentially removed any control the states had over the federal government, which, in the words of the founders, is ""a creature by, and to further the ends, of the states.""

And speaking of the VP, originally the VP was the person that got second place in the presidential election, which caused problems because they were frequently of a different party than the winner. But that made sense, because, again, the VP is supposed to represent the federal government to the Senate. In fact, his _sole responsibility_ in the Constitution is to be president of, and to preside over, the Senate. 

The point is that, yes, its true that a certain amount of over representation of the smaller states was baked into the system, _but not this much,_ and not in this way. And the problem only gets worse as time goes on. Population breeds more population, so, over time, the populations of the large states increases at a significantly faster rate than that of the smaller states, further diluting their representation and further increasing the over-representation of the small states. 

A simple fix for this is to increase the size of the House. It could be done by an act of congress. Common suggestions are to make it about 900 people. These additional reps can be distributed using current methods, and would results in the large states have more representatives. It would also alter the math of the electoral college, by correspondingly increasing their electoral votes, as well as increasing the number of votes you need to win, since you need half plus 1.   If the Dems upped it to 150k it was likely because in some places in this country, 150k is about the same as 75k.   *shoulda been deemed president but that‚Äôs neither here nor there*   It's because you have a bunch of selfish idiots running the country.   It's a tool a principled politician can use to affect change. Yeah, it's weird and parliamentary and I'd prefer it be gone, but sometimes that's all there is left.   This. If the whole idea is to stimulate the economy then why worry about someone getting 2k who made more than 100k? The money will get spent and someone who made over 100k will likely benefit from it anyway.   That‚Äôs fair, I think the article is vague. It suggests permitting some amount of ‚Äúassets,‚Äù but seems to be contemplating goods rather than cash. I read it as proposing no inheritance of cash, but rereading it now I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the intent.   Because that is what he always does, he is going to kick up such a stink that people will concede to his demands just so he goes away. 

We've seen this episode   It‚Äôs there in the wall fund - isn‚Äôt it   That photo is perfect. Good stuff.   I just said call the vote   But that doesn‚Äôt jive with how we acts about his game and about his courses. He consistently claims he‚Äôs ~7 points better on his handicap than he probably is (~10 according to pga and lpga pros who have played multiple rounds with him.) With his courses only being described as ostentatious except for turnberry which he did very little as far as overhauling the courses look and layout.   If votes like that are tossed, then it theoretically is decided by the house on a per-state basis as no candidate has an absolute majority of electoral votes, not that that is any better.   That's the spirit!   Everything that doesn't involve enriching David Perdue has been in quarantine his entire life so this shouldn't be too hard for him   It is going to the tea party final form.  We thought it was the libertarians, but then they decided to throw us a curveball.   [deleted]   Or penis shaped glitter bombs. 

https://shipyourenemiesglitter.com   Looks like Pennsylvania had 110% participation rate. Hmmm, wonder how that happened.   Hey guys, he works hard for his money. It is a lot of work to impede the tide of progress and fuck over the lifeblood of every company while helping take down any obstacles for said companies to accomplish their corporate objectives at literally any cost. Give him a break.   At this point I wouldn‚Äôt even classify it as all that radical a statement or solution.   It kinda sounds like that mess is designed to depress the vote for things like president and congress.   We are in strange times. I was a life long Republican until 2013 and I‚Äôm currently independent. I‚Äôm not a Biden fan but Trump is a disaster. I know I‚Äôll never vote for a single Republican that supported this insanity.   The fact that he will lose while being backed by the overwhelming majority of Americans tells you all you need to know about 'Murica. Public sentiment, and policy are entirely unhinged from one another. Anytime a politician does something you agree with (especially true of Repugs right now) it is only a coincidence.   He seems to be doing this again now by denying states, especially states with Dem governors and states that swung blue, vaccines   I wanna see them bare knuckle box for it.   Go Bernie Go!   [deleted]   It's absolutely ridiculous that you can't see how it would be a punishment if we specifically went out of our way to put the people who took it seriously the entire time at the bottom of the list. We aren't talking about a scenario where people get it first based on who is most vulnerable, we a talking about a scenario where the more seriously people took it this entire time, the longer they have to wait until their lives can get back to normal or at least closer too it. That would be completely unfair and would reward asshole behavior which then encourages asshole behavior. Fortunately they never will punish people for being responsible because the people in charge know how stupid and unfair that would be.   Fat orange pig   A decade is far too long to put up with his shit, unfortunately. Man, if democrats could have put together a real message during the election, we would have probably won the senate outright.   Love you, Bernie!! Always fighting for the little guy!   American's when polled love Bernie. He had the highest favoribilty of any dem during the primary, but America's were constantly told by corporate media that he couldn't possibly win, and unfortunately they believed it.   How many Democrats voted for that   Remember those who prefer dictatorship over democracy.   A rare breed of stupid.   I got my family in GA to switch and vote for Ossoff and Warnock. That's 3 votes for you guys.

However I'm sure everyone is worried because the Insider Trading Crook Kelly Loeffler and Crook David Perdue do have supporters. 

What is your plan to defeat them Jan 5 when their huge deluge of supporters will show up? Do you think the early votes are enough?   No   If only dems would use it as a talking point. Most likely they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúoh guys they didn‚Äôt do that on purpose.‚Äù Tired of dems giving gop the benefit of the doubt. Not even benefit of the doubt. I doubt it actually goes over anyone‚Äôs heads in Congress.   I guarantee you he has no idea how to even work an iphone, let alone venmo someone. This dude sucks.   That‚Äôs Cornyn from the miserable state of Texas!.,?   Ew.   Narcissists need you to play to their sense of self.   March 31, LOL. We'll see what President Biden thinks about that.   Probably. I'd say absolutely if he got fucking back packed the way Biden was, but I wouldn't past our major media organizations to just lambast him for his disagreement with their personal ideology, even with trump as the alternative. It's hard to imagine a candidate winning the presidency these days without one of the major media groups directly supporting them these days.   Eric Garland had been posting about this on Twitter. Apparently the US Virgin Islands prosecutors have been all over it.   Damn that‚Äôs exactly what he reminds of and that movie creeped the fuck outta me as a grown adult lol   They do understand that, but giving people a taste of wealth distribution plants a lot of seeds in the public consciousness that the GOP and, more broadly, capitalists, would rather remain obscure.   Turn down your misinformation man.   Mass or Oregon? Because they both have 2 on that list!   [deleted]   georgian senators are getting a lot of attention just because this race happens to be very tight and also impactful of the senate majority. the GOP senators weren't expecting a run for their money.

so now suddenly we're seeing one GOP senator too scared to debate, and the other one who can't answer for her obvious conflict of interest. they thought they had it in the bag in georgia.

that's the only reason we're paying attention to these two guys, not because they're prepared for a presidential run.   Shit eating traitor. How anti-democratic do you have to be for an election to be anti-good. Their side wins is a legitimate election. If the other side wins, Emmys. Voter fraud, the two are quite literally mutuall. exclusive.   Most hard red states that are often derided as ""takers"" should instead be viewed as victims of generations of internal colonialism. Which you have articulated the end game of quite well.   There should absolutely be no opt out. Vote or don't vote, but you will be registered. How about when you get an ID you are also registered?

It's insane to me that we don't have automatic voter registration. That, and it should be updated when you do a change of address with the USPS.

Automatic voter registration. Universal vote by mail. Make voting a national holiday. I don't believe voting needs to be mandatory, but it's 2020, and there should be almost no barrier at this point to get people to vote.   McConnell: ‚Äúsploosh‚Äù   or maybe just too much coke   The problem is the original protestor wanted literally defund the police and then later leftists moved that back to ""move the funding around in the police"".

I don't know how anyone could be dumb enough to publicly support something branded as defund the police.

But then they get on the news and say no we don't want to just change how the money is spent we want to literally get rid of the police. Every grandma heard that and is now republican for life.   [deleted]   He looks like a Sith Lord.   That double sucks! Im sorry to hear that. Fuck our politicians for doing us so dirty.   \[Graham, speaking to aide\] ""Be a dear, see if you can find any records of me saying ""*A row of big black cocks.*""   so, we keep raising the price of their insulin (or letting them raise the price of their own insulin through idiotic political choices), and then once enough of them are dead, we move in moderately intelligent people from New York state and have them vote Democrat?   Because it‚Äôs a stimulus check you fucking 4head. That money goes toward paying off existing debt (held by a corporation), stuck in the bank to be used a month or two later Bc things still aren‚Äôt looking up (used by the bank to make money and give the customers nothing), or to buy stupid shit they don‚Äôt need (weird again the money ends up going to a company). It doesn‚Äôt matter what they do with it, it will get spent. It will end up back in the pockets of the wealthy. Americans are notoriously really fucking bad at saving money and we are incredibly materialistic and hampered by rampant consumerism. 

If you want to make sure businesses survive, if you want to give money to huge corporations, if you want to make the rich richer, then give the money to ordinary people. We, as Americans, are really fucking good at going out and spending money.   Yup and this sub is straight infested with neoliberal thought.  Any mention of the fact that over half of the dnc are actually conservatives who are socially liberal on subjects like abortion and lgbtq+ rights gets you on the down vote train.  They are pro war, pro corporation, 'fiscally conservative' deficit hawks working for the same corporate masters as the republicans.   [deleted]   The very first sentence of the twelfth amendment states:

&gt; The Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate; -- The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; -- The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.



&gt; Still, the lawsuit asserted that **Pence ‚Äúmay exercise the exclusive authority and sole discretion in determining which electoral votes to count for a given state**, and must ignore and may not rely on any provisions of the Electoral Count Act that would limit his exclusive authority and his sole discretion to determine the count, which could include votes from the slates of Republican electors from the Contested States.‚Äù



This line of reasoning implies that the VP has **absolute power** to determine the next president and makes the first sentence of the amendment meaningless.   I think you missed the sarcasm in the post.  Unarmed as in people with no arms not guns.   GOP is worst than cancer   Babies.   Then why did they say he was Kkk then? 
People usually do not say that stuff just randomly..   That's a very individualistic take on this - our country is on the brink of an economic crisis.  Yes, $600 is better than nothing, but...

There's a pretty strong economic argument that without more than $600, we'll be facing an eviction crisis and a mortgage crisis, then a local and state tax crisis and ultimately a total inability of local and state governments to function in some cases (e.g. zero budget to pay anyone who draws a check from a municipality - firemen, police, county clerks, courts etc.)

I won't be getting a stimulus check, but I 100% back the push for larger individual stimulus and the more people who qualify, the better.   Hoping for the government to pull people out of their own student loan debt is fucking stupid. You picked the school, you signed on the line, you got the degree. I paid back 80k between me and my wife, but it took us 10 years. They need to fix the tuition problem and that will fix the loan issue PERMANENTLY.   I dunno bud. I was heavily involved with occupy. Like, I traveled from camp to camp down most of the east coast.   


I have no doubt that the CIA was there. I'm confident that I had conversations with agents, but also the whole structure of it was simply bad for focused messaging   This might be a sign of how much clout Trump has with the GOP. Once the Georgia senate runnofs are over they will  break the kayfabe.   Are they even alive then?   Why, yes. Yes they are.   If you want to hold some criticism for the move that's fine. But this isn't ""voting against your fundamentals"", it's ""not playing games over something that shouldn't be a game"".   basically just him tightening up immigration and making it hard for people to immigrate here. it sucks :(   Kentucky went for Clinton both terms.   ""Months after""

Are Washington Post articles written by a Leftist Redditor?   [deleted]   Yeah, I know what a single party state is, it's a state in which voting is pointless. 

Unless you feel voting third party is a smart use of your vote?   ""at least with the GOP, we *know* they're corrupt.""

that's my favorite   Bernie is the man we need but don't deserve.   Just a thing, Mexico is pretty racist and xenophobic too. It's less flashy and notorious, but pretty insidious nonetheless.   [deleted]   I've heard this from the legal community here too. Though distasteful and egregious, its not illegal. 

They can choose to support whatever they want, its the electorate that decides our national identity. 

The current GOP is a symptom of a much more broad set of problems that really seem to coincide with Nixon, and then Reagan. The acquisition and hoarding of a massive amount of wealth has only created a grotesque party of elitists.   Name another senator who has fought this long and hard for his people. Name another senator who lost in a race for the presidency and went back to working just as hard as he did before for his people. This isn‚Äôt just another comment supporting Burnie, I‚Äôm actually asking are their any other senators who actually care this much for the people of this country?   &gt; The Nordic model could very well be the best model under a capitalist framework.

True.  It could also be the best model under *any* framework in 2020.  I personally detest capitalism, but we ought to follow evidence.  

&gt;Is your argument that no better system could possibly exist absent a capitalist framework

According to the data, it's the best we've managed to come up with.   Evidence has also led us to things not traditionally considered 'capitalist.'  For instance, that diversity improves things.  That having women in the boardroom improves things.  That transparency and regulation are good for business.  Non-ideological pursuit of metrics is part of progressivism, IMHO. 

&gt;will eventually run into the same problems as all capitalism based models given a long enough timeline.

That's speculative.   ""Cowardice"" is so often used as a kind of slur, comparable to emasculated. It's usually a man to man insult. So often used to describe violent, uncivil acts that, honestly, take an evil, psychopathic sort of guts. Like Hawley or terrorists.

They aren't cowards, they're very bad people. They're not ""less than"" men. They're really bad men.   Is there no one investigating this?   It is.   Need a whole new congress and senate.   Need to get rid of career politicians that are more interested in their financial benefits than the people.  Term limits would be a start and regulation on income sources while in office.   But what politician would be interested anything that could limit their own personal gain   True but Mitch gets more attention and that‚Äôs how the internet works   This is a good thing, considering the damage he can do otherwise..

sports,2021,"  The thing with most high level programs is there is no time for education. They work out 40 plus hours a week while balancing a school load is near impossible. Want to focus on education well guess your on the bench with the potential to lose the scholarship for lack of performance the following year.

Yes college basketball will survive but the level of competition is not going to be there. Yes the superstars will go straight to the big show but everyone else now has the ability to make money. There was no third option before hand or even now. If the NBA starts seeing better players come out of the G league because the players are performing better because there is no charade of student athletes then most higher tier players will opt for the G league. Most players going to power schools are going for the dream not the education.   Sets a pretty shitty example for your kids if you're expecting someone to turn down a multi-million dollar career and the ability to set his family up for the next generation or two in exchange for a $100k degree that they can go back and get after their careers if they want to.   It's more the athletic commission than the league, but Japan did allow stomps and soccer kicks back in the Pride days. I'm not sure if they still can in Rizin or maybe OneFC  currently or not, but you can't in any commission that uses the unified rules.   You don't vote for kings.   Yeah, that whole thing was pushed by MJ because he's a little bit of a sociopath who needs to invent enemies because he's uber-competitive asshole. Dude was honestly a shitty role model and he spent his whole HOF speech shitting on most of the people he should've been thanking. That's also what helped turned him into the best basketball player in the world though.   Because the one and done has been so good to college basketball...   This link has been shared 1 time.

Jonathan FUCKING Toews... could he have ripped up the O? Next question please and throw a salt of respect on college hockey   Curious, why is THIS the armed forces bowl, but neither the Army, Navy, nor Air Force game combos are?   Almost all of the Badgers fans that I know also at least loosely follow Marquette. It's not much of a rivalry for UW fans because Marquette is the \#2 team for most of them. 

Marquette fans have this fucking weird little brother syndrome and the UW game is their super bowl. 

I'm just over here like, the Badgers are my team that will be well coached and make good tournament runs. And Marquette is my team that is fucking nauseating to watch because they're so inconsistent and poorly coached, but at least I'll get to watch some of those players for years in the NBA."

This made me laugh really hard   I dont want them to know a lot.  And not because its bad or dangerous, its that some things are cultural and wouldn't go over well with my family because of their belief system.  Some things are best kept private.   It really depends on the situation. Most people hate that because they would start feel used. I also think it becomes more of an issue if it's a pattern. For example, lets say I had a friend who only called me up when they need me for something and never spoke to me other than that, I would be pretty upset. If it was a one time thing, I probably wouldn't care.   Yes but private and much nicer, with more land.   I don‚Äôt understand how writing it down is harder. You literally write a number, that‚Äôs it. Compared to manually counting out the coins, especially when some cards can lead to counting out several stacks.

Like freedom is good but freedom and stupid are about equivalent here unfortunately.   I'm not a teenager and I'm not optimistic for the new year at all; 2021 isn't going to be better until the COVID  vaccine comes out, and it doesn't matter how optimistic a person is.

Even relegating this to just day-to-day life events, there's no inherent reason to assume positivity *or* negativity for next year. It's better to do just be spontaneous and accepting.   The guy can‚Äôt handle sex scenes on tv because he ‚Äúhad a porn addiction‚Äù and expects the world to cater to his deficiencies and lack of control. Did you expect less cringe from him?   No...*It can't be*...

I always wonder who the intended audience is. Adults generally (in my experience) don't need super sexy sex stuff, unless they're specifically going for something that will literally facilitate sexy time. There's a good middle ground out there, but I think the popularity of Spartacus, and GoT made other show runners think that the super sexy all the time boobs out, butts out thing is what made the shows popular.   It's also possible that people feel that way and just want to talk about it... I'm not a teen or edgy, but based on the trajectory and timeline of a lot of our current issues, I've been feeling that 2021 will be worse. I'm not the only one.   So true   I came looking for an argument not a logical response, but you're right, &amp; I respect that.   Wonder why huh   I was being overly dramatic last night. I don‚Äôt think Chess is trash. I just look at the board and think if I really wanted to get into it most games would end in a draw. I looked up the history of chess. Modern chess changed a few rules didn‚Äôt it? Made the Queen strongest piece ?!?! Idk. I was drunk of course and was looking for a catching title. It‚Äôs true I barely understand the secondary rules like castling and en passant. I believe chess is a thinking game of course but it seems like the first couple moves are safe then if everyone plays it safe it ends in a draw. Certain strategies alter the game but isn‚Äôt there like 20-30 of these that we know? We call them by the people that made their moves at the time. I‚Äôm not stupid or an idiot. I know this is a complete 180 about what i was blabbering about last night but do you think it‚Äôs possible to change the rules so all games end with a winner? Can a computer figure it out? Idk. I apologize to the die hard chess community. I‚Äôm actually trying to build my own game with aspects of chess but with interaction. Candle in the middle of the board where you use a chip, penny beer cap where you stand back a couple feet (5) and try to blow out candle with item that makes the game more satisfying then just using dye or Chance. Thanks for reading if you commented earlier and I hope you guys understand where I was coming from when I made this post. I wasn‚Äôt conveying my message enough cuz I was chocolate wasted. Chess is what it is but I would like to create a more interactive game with certain same rules where there is a winner at the end. Happy New Year to you and the ones you love! Which should be everyone (some can be excluded) here‚Äôs to 2021 !!! Cheers!!!!!!   Good twist from the OP.   The fact is however if you have oversized boobs the surgery to reduce them allows you to specify the size of both the boobs and the nipples and you never have to have surgery again. For small tit women the enhancement surgery requires unnatural materials to be added to your chest and requires updates every ten years.  Also the size of the nipples can‚Äôt be adjusted. 

So I‚Äôd think it would be better to be well endowed and have to go smaller then to be too small and have to get larger.   Of course the other option is to live with what you‚Äôve got but I think large breasted women have the advantage as far as palatable options.   It probably won't teach them anything.  It's likely they'll just suffer through it until it's over.  Which at least will be relatively harmless.  It's not the worst thing in the world, and they might be able to draw some experience from it, but don't expect a magical attitude turnaround like you see happen in cheesy coming of age movies.

You can raise their awareness of how the world is to some degree, but you can't force someone to be more sympathetic to those who are worse off.  Throwing them in the vicinity of a homeless person isn't automatically going to do it.  The kid has to be somewhat receptive to it and has to partly develop it on their own, or it's just some meaningless value that they have to fake because their parents told them so, then abandon as soon as they're on their own.  

The thing about teens actively sabotaging it, as OP mentioned,  is far less likely unless they are outright sociopaths.   Nope   Well at least 2020 is over now   You mean Mr Bean?   I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the real problem that some people didn‚Äôt have a bad 2020. It was the best year of my life. But reposting about reposting?   [https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Game\_Master\_List](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Game_Master_List)

It's one of the popular games being preserved by bluemaxima's flashpoint. However, other, lesser known games will, unfortunately, cease to exist.   Do you have money saved in the bank, though?

Definitely an unpopular opinion... but if you‚Äôre young and able bodied, working ensures that you‚Äôre taken care of when you‚Äôre old and not able bodied.  By doing nothing, you‚Äôre not preparing *at all* for what the future will bring.  Do you want to have kids?  Start saving. You‚Äôll need the money to give them a productive childhood. 

I mean... I guess not working is fine if you plan on never having kids and you don‚Äôt care if you end up in a crappy apartment with 19 year old neighbors when you‚Äôre 60.  Other than that, it makes absolutely no sense not to work unless you‚Äôre really really lazy.  Like... top 1% lazy.   Lol how can time itself be controlled/made by people

What 15 year olds thinks this   Probably some sort of mass-delusion   &gt;A few celebrities died. That was it, really.

OLD celebrities too.   bear left   The only good thing 2020 has given me was going back home to be with my family. However I lost my jobs, my depression/anxiety is an all time high, &amp; about to file for bankruptcy. So...

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/unpopularopinion) if you have any questions or concerns.*   Are you an adult?   The way I view it is that so many of these gratuitous sex scenes in shows now are like any gratuitous or pointless scene. If they aren't advancing the plot, advancing character development or even contributing to atmosphere, then I am bored silly. It's actually not sexy at all (and this is coming from a very non-prudish person). It's dull, and it makes you so aware of the people behind the show trying to titillate the audience rather than tell a story. So it takes you out of it the world you are meant to be immersed in. It's so juvenile a lot of the time.

Also, one of my problems is particularly with American television's portrayal of sexuality. Why is it so dark all the time? Why is it (almost) constantly about people using each other, hurting each other, lying to each other through sex? It's got this kind of puritanical streak to it, like pointing and giggling at nude bodies while at the same time lecturing people of the dangers of sex all the time.

Look, people will laugh at me here, but take a recent show like *Emily in Paris*. Yeah, it wasn't a good show. It wasn't even my type of show, but I watched it due to, you know, covid boredom. But the sex in that show was at least fun and funny. It didn't bother anyone, it was part of the farcical nature of the show. It didn't go on for longer than it needed to and could be sweet too. That to me is so much better than the 20th teen show with all the teens raping each other every two seconds or having consensual yet violent type sex. The latter makes me think of a group of lame adults sitting around a writers room thinking they are being ""so edgy"".

To sum up, if it's an integral part of the story, that's totally fine, but most often nowadays it's not and it bores me shitless. Actually a friend last night told me how she watched the new Bridgerton show and got through it so quickly because she fast forwarded through huge chunks of it because the sex scenes were so long and so boring.   What are the ""bunch more"" that you are talking about? There was a reason for almost every sex scene in GoT. The scene that really had no purpose that I can think of right now was in S3E1 between Bronn and a prostitute. It was just there. Didn't really add anything new. However, the scene you are talking about is the one in S2E1 slightly prior to Robert's bastards being murdered, am I correct? That sex scene had a purpose. It sets up that Ros is slowly becoming a bigger player of the Game of Thrones and that she becomes more confident and with that increase in confidence she accepts work for Varys and tries to climb the ladder of power, although she eventually fell from the ladder and died as a result (chaos is a ladder). So it basically showed that she has become more of a leader in there, and in a way is shaping up to even be Littlefinger's ""bottom bitch"".   I hardly doubt that‚Äôs why   Bridgerton was the same. 30 seconds in and I am staring at a pasty white ass and a woman fake moaning and being fucked against a tree. Completely ruined it.   &gt;before the big bang

No, space-time did not exist before the big bang.

The concept of Time is just a tool we use to navigate our experience, it doesn't exist per se.

Space-time seems to be a real thing, though, you can't really separate them.

Anyway, OP's topic is not an opinion and it seems like a r/rant

Edit: Clarity   [deleted]   I think all sex scenes are important to the narrative. As I see it sex is used to represent power. The slave holders decide who they fuck. And which slaves get to fuck. 

Sex out of love is seen as a form of rebellion.   Mind your own business   [removed]   All day baby   Whoops. I guess its not as unpopular as I thought   It's 2021 in Scotland, looked outside, seems much the same, cold.   Probably full frontal nudity combined with 2 or more sex scenes per episode within the backdrop of zero storyline   I consider the best day in my life the day my son was born.

[deleted]   &gt;Being assertive and being good at communication are things you need to be taught and learn to develop.

In my experience being assertive just comes with time and experience and realizing that you're just gonna keep missing out if you don't stand up for yourself. But they literally teach entire college and highschool courses in communication, so I'm not sure what you're getting at. 

&gt; The reason I wouldn't have made an effort is because I was too shy to go out of my way to apply for a job or be assertive within the workplace.  

You'd be surprised at what a few years of getting your ass kicked will push you to do. You don't need to be assertive in the workplace, what the hell does that even mean? Just do your damn job. 

&gt; I was an introvert. 

Being an introvert isn't a disability. A lot of introverts do just fine in the job market because doing your job isn't a social function.  No one gives a damn if Janet in accounting is an outgoing spirit.   I feel the same way about shredded cheese.   ‚ÄúIt sure is, sir!‚Äù   What makes 2020 bad was that every human was impacted by it. Some people might have had singular victories or good memories, but humanity as a whole suffered for what happened in 2020   Lin Manuel is like the ugliest house on a block filled with mansions. Personally I found his acting cringeworthy in Hamilton and purely nauseating in His Dark Materials. He speaks and sings as if he has a lump in his throat and his voice comes off incredibly forced. But in almost every role he‚Äôs acted in, he‚Äôs surrounded by out of this world amazing talent. The Hamilton cast was purely phenomenal and Lin Manuel would have never been cast as the lead of such amazing talent if it wasn‚Äôt his own musical. In his dark materials his character in terms of writing and role had the potential to be the highlight of the entire series. Instead he ends up being the weakest character with the weakest scenes purely because of Lin Manuel. I mean even a CGI bear is outperforming him by far. His writing is great though ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.   Honestly i think he does it purely for the feel good feeling. Fair enough id say!   The main difference being that Mr. Bean is funny   Lol. I guess blankets aren‚Äôt so good at beating down your foes either   You would have to continuously write down the number each time it changes, you‚Äôd have to write down the bets, the calls, verbally share that infoC everything that is much more easily managed with coins or chips. There is no scenario under which writing it down would be more effective than using coins or chips.   I think I would love working out with you. You would be a great motivator.   I had a teen SJW take offense to me using the word Indian in a comment. I told her I got the habit from Natives I have interacted with throughout my life and from the friends and relatives of my late wife(who was native), and my current wife who describes herself occasionally as an Indian. The SJW then proceeded to tell me, that it was my responsibility to tell the ""Indigenous people"" that it is wrong for them to call themselves that, because it's, ""the language of the oppressors""! Guess what? I'm not going to a Pow Wow and jumping on the case every native who says the word Indian! I'll leave that up to her!

IMO, she's being too sensitive.   &gt;Save

Only people in Massachusetts have the delusion.   [deleted]   it's fun   I like the wagon wheel variant   Thank you for submitting to /r/unpopularopinion, /u/Doggy9000. Your post, *Hating on someone because of their religious affiliation is stupid and/or trying to convert them to yours is also stupid.*, has been removed because it violates our rules:


Rule 1: Your post must be an unpopular opinion.

Please ensure that your post is an opinion and that it is unpopular. Controversial is not necessarily unpopular, for example all of politics is controversial even though almost half of the US agrees with any given major position on an issue.

Keep in mind that an opinion is not: a question, a fact, a conspiracy theory, a random thought, a new idea, a rant, etc. Those things all have their own subreddits, use those.

If there is an issue, please message the mod team at https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Funpopularopinion Thanks!   You don‚Äôt get much better than the $30 t shirt. You can get some pretty sweet designs too. Fit? Mate it‚Äôs not a tailor made suit   I'm also tired of hearing that it's the worst year ever. It wasn't terrible for everybody.   my school had to cancel dodgeball as a sport bc one of the students got hit in the head and got a concussion   You work in IT don't you?   Upvoted because I disagree and I think this is an unpopular opinion   But, I‚Äôm not from there   Well, all his friends were back in the lower 48 as well. I don't know, he did an awful lot of jigsaw puzzles and yard work for a kid with access to the internet.   With card games, I‚Äôm not talking shit like blackjack or whatever. This is basic stuff like crazy eights, three 10ps, farmers market etc. There is no need to write down bets or calls. As for continuously writing the number, how is that different from constantly swapping coins except that you write it down instead of having to manually count and find the coins?   Train wheels objectively make everything that doesnt taste better with long noodles taste better. 

Also fuck normal spaghetti noodles they‚Äôre unironically nasty. Angel hair is the only way to go.   Cause I'm not that smart but I'll keep that in mind   Lol yesüòÇ Just yes to that whole thing you just said I freaking feel it.   I think people are misinterpreting your post, you clearly said there were exceptions. I know what you mean how some people think people telling them ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs a shitty thing to say‚Äù as a sign they‚Äôre the only free thinker on the planet. It really is weak   how ab this :\]   [deleted]   wait i thought Pornos addiction was only a meme.
God I'm wasted   i never praised the first Final Fantasy game, but i still disagree. 

Final Fantasy came out in 1987 and was extremely simple due to the amount of bugs such as effective weapons literally not having any damage modifiers for what they're supposed to be effective against, some spells simply failing to work as intended. it also released on weaker hardware and still had an open world with an airship, a slightly more complex storyline including time travel. playing the psp version of final fantasy one makes it a much deeper experience despite the fact the psp version is easier than the nes version

judging Mystic Quest more fairly would be to compare it with final fantasy 4 since that's what it was most closely released to (before Final Fantasy 5). that game had much deeper combat and a much deeper story. i understand that Mystic Quest isn't trying to be that at ALL and that's okay, but saying it was extremely simple is an understatement when every battle is completely effortless, even for someone who hasn't played rpgs very much   Popular opinion   My wife and I didn‚Äôt make them volunteer as punishment, we had them volunteer as part of our raising well rounded kids.

Have you seen the adults? What a shocker xD   Same thing   Who said Halsey can identify as black? Halsey HERSELF said she is white passing and has white privilege. Race IS skin deep holy shit you‚Äôre so dense and ignorant. Know the difference between race, nationality, and ethnicity then come talk to me.

All my homies hate dark chocolate...... milk chocolate is where it‚Äôs at   Well, there is being objective and using people. 
The first is fine, the second not so much.   That‚Äôs what culture is though! A set of shared values, interests etc that bind a group of people together. So if someone does something that is largely unknown/unfamiliar to the wider culture, they are going to be seen as somewhat of an outsider - until these things become popular enough that they become part of said culture. 

E.g. you could say KPop is becoming part of American culture due to its growing popularity, it doesn‚Äôt matter where it originated from.   Back then it was all raw talent/ skill. 

Now it's lab created and perfected. Totally different.   That'd make hunting them a lot easier.  I like this idea.   Hi, my 2020 was fucking amazing! I study from home, and it's great, all my classes are recorded too, so now I can sleep late when I want to. Also, I landed a part time job that I've been looking for for many months. Got to move back in with my parents, which is nice, because now I'm in my hometown, and thus I got to spend a lot of time with my older friends. And I could rent out my own apartment, since I am not in need of it for now! I've always been a mild introvert, so now instead of going over to people, I can play online games with my close friends and have tons of fun (they were very averse to doing things online before). Oh, and have I mentioned I finally get to eat my moms cooking all the time? Fucking amazing year.   Gonna use this thread to discuss my 2020.

Really weird year for me. I got the news that I passed my CPA exam in January and for the first time in my life, I didn‚Äôt know what the next step was. 

There was no short term or long term goal in mind. Do I buy a place now, or do I keep renting. Do I keep doing my hobby even though it‚Äôs kind of a waste of time or do I start putting all my focus into my career. Should I try to get into a serious relationship or keep being single. 

The fact that there‚Äôs no immediate goal made my life feel pretty unstructured. Then covid contributed to the chaos as well. And to be honest, I kind of wasted this year doing nothing. I tried to get back in shape and failed. I still don‚Äôt know whether to buy a place. Still single. Still not sure what to do with my spare time.

This feels like a lost year.   [deleted]   You go out after 8 and call ride, no state to drive   NTA. Your year your rules.   Couldn‚Äôt agree more   You play bitlife, thats a game, get away from me school shooter.   Reminds of the movie Dodge Ball. Dodge, dip, duck, dive and.... dodge.   I really don't, I have a good sex life with my boyfriend, I'll talk with my friends about sex, just don't need to see strangers moaning lol Adam Sandler is American Mr Been Sandler‚Äôs movies represent the same level of basic grotesque and just picture stereotypical character and charm of the nation.
